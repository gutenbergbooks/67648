<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>The history of democracy&#8217;s progress in a mid-Western
city&mdash;so, to introduce this book in specific
terms, one perhaps inevitably must call it. Yet in
using the word <i>democracy</i>, one must plead for a distinction,
or, better, a reversion, indicated by the
curious anchylosis that, at a certain point in their
maturity, usually sets in upon words newly put in
use to express some august and large spiritual reality.
We all know how this materializing tendency,
if one may call it that, has affected our notion and
our use of the commonest religious terms like <i>faith</i>,
<i>grace</i>, <i>salvation</i>, for instance. Their connotation,
originally fluid, spiritual and subjective, has become
concrete, limited, partial, ignoble. So, too, in our
common speech, even above the catchpenny vocabulary
of the demagogue or politician, the word <i>democracy</i>
has taken on the limited, partial and ignoble
connotation of more or less incidental and
provisional forms of democracy&#8217;s practical outcome;
or even of by-products not directly traceable to
the action of democracy itself. How often, for example,
do we see direct primaries, the single tax,
the initiative and referendum posed in a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
sacramental relation to &#8220;fundamental democracy&#8221;;
or the &#8220;essential movement of democracy&#8221; measured,
say, by the increased returns on the Socialist
ticket at some local election!</p>

<p>The permanent value of this book is that it proceeds
out of a truly adequate and philosophical conception
of democracy. That the collective human
spirit should know itself, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#951;
&#7957;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, that the state, the communal unit, should be,
in Mr. Arnold&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;the expression of our best
self, which is not manifold and vulgar and unstable
and contentious and ever varying, but one and noble
and secure and peaceful and the same for all mankind&#8221;;
here we have in outline the operation of
democracy. One could not give this volume higher
praise than to say, as in justice one must say, that
it clearly discerns and abundantly conveys the
spirit which works in human nature toward this end.</p>

<p>How important it is to maintain this fluid, philosophical
and spiritual view of democracy may be
seen when we look about us and consider the plight
of those&mdash;especially the many now concerned in
politics, whether professionally or as eager amateurs&mdash;who
for lack of it confuse various aspects of
the political problem of liberty with the social problem
of equality. With political liberty or with self-expression
of the individual in politics, democracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
has, and ever has had, very little to do. It is our
turbid thought about democracy that prevents our
seeing this. The aristocratic and truculent barons
did more for the political freedom of Englishmen
than was ever done by democracy; a selfish and
sensual king did more to gain the individual Englishman
his freedom of self-expression in politics.
In our own country it is matter of open and notorious
fact that a political party whose every sentiment
and tendency is aristocratic has been the one
to bring about the largest measures of political enfranchisement.
Now, surely, one may heartily welcome
every enlargement of political liberty, but if
one attributes them to a parentage which is not
theirs, if one relates them under <i>democracy</i>, the
penalty which nature inexorably imposes upon error
is sure to follow. If, therefore, in the following
pages the author seems occasionally lukewarm
toward certain enfranchising measures, I do not
understand that he disparages them, but only that
he sees&mdash;as their advocates, firmly set in the confusion
we speak of, cannot see&mdash;that their connection
with democracy is extremely indistinct and remote.
<i>Equality</i>&mdash;a social problem, not to be
worked out by the mechanics of politics, but appealing
wholly to the best self, the best reason and
spirit of man,&mdash;this is democracy&#8217;s concern, democracy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
chief interest. It is to our author&#8217;s
praise, again, that he sees this clearly and expresses
it convincingly.</p>

<p>By far the most admirable and impressive picture
in this book appears to me to be that which the
author has all unconsciously drawn of himself. It
reveals once more that tragedy&mdash;the most profound,
most common and most neglected of all the multitude
of useless tragedies that our weak and wasteful
civilization by sheer indifference permits&mdash;the
tragedy of a richly gifted nature denied the opportunity
of congenial self-expression. What by comparison
is the tragedy of starvation, since so very
many willingly starve, if haply they may find this
opportunity? The author is an artist, a born artist.
His natural place is in a world unknown and
undreamed of by us children of an age commissioned
to carry out the great idea of industrial and political
development. He belongs by birthright in the
eternal realm of divine impossibilities, of sublime
and delightful inconsistencies. Greatly might he
have fulfilled his destiny in music, in poetry, in painting
had he been born at one of those periods when
spiritual activity was all but universal, when spiritual
ideas were popular and dominant, <i>volitantes per
ora virum</i>, part of the very air one breathed&mdash;in
the Greece of Pericles, the England of Elizabeth, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
on the Tuscan hills at the time of the Florentine
Renaissance! But this was not to be. An admirer,
jealous of every possible qualification, reminds me
that I should call him at least a philosophical artist;
yes, but not by nature even that. The toga did not
drop upon him readymade from a celestial loom. It
was woven and fitted laboriously by his own hands.
He sought philosophical consistency and found it
and established himself in it; but only as part of
the difficult general discipline of an alien life.</p>

<p>What an iron discipline, and how thoroughly alien
a life, stands revealed to the eye of poetic insight
and the spirit of sympathetic delicacy, on every
page of these memoirs. For the over-refined (as we
say), the oversensitive soul of a born artist&mdash;think
of the experience, think of the achievement! The
very opposite of all that makes a politician, appraising
politics always at their precise value, yet patiently
spending all the formative years of his life
in the debilitating air of politics for the sake of what
he might indirectly accomplish. Not an executive,
yet incessantly occupied with tedious details of administrative
work, for the satisfaction of knowing
them well done. Not a philosopher, yet laboriously
making himself what Glanvil quaintly calls &#8220;one of
those larger souls who have traveled the divers climates
of opinion&#8221; until he acquired a social philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
that should meet his own exacting demands.</p>

<p>Is it too much, then, that I invite the reader&#8217;s
forbearance with these paragraphs to show why our
author should himself take rank and estimation with
the great men whom he reverently pictures? He
tells the story of Altgeld and of Johnson, energetic
champions of the newer political freedom. He tells
the story of Jones, the incomparable true democrat,
one of the children of light and sons of the Resurrection,
such as appear but once in an era. And in
the telling of these men and of himself as the alien
and, in his own view, largely accidental continuator
of their work, it seems to me that he indicates the
process by which he too has worked out his own
position among them as &#8220;one of those consoling
and hope-inspiring marks which stand forever to
remind our weak and easily discouraged race how
high human goodness and perseverance have once
been carried and may be carried again.&#8221;</p>

<p>One hot afternoon in the summer of my tenth
year, my grandfather, having finished the nap he was
accustomed to take after the heavy dinner which, in
those days, was served at noon in his house, told me
that I might go up town with him. This was not
only a relief, but a prospect of adventure. It was
a relief to have him finish his nap, because while he
was taking his nap, my grandmother drew down
at all the windows the heavy green shades, which,
brought home by the family after a residence in Nuremberg,
were decorated at the bottom with a frieze
depicting scenes along the Rhine, and a heavy and
somnolent silence was imposed on all the house.
When my grandfather took his nap, life seemed to
pause, all activities were held in suspense.</p>

<p>And the prospect was as a pleasant adventure,
because whenever my grandfather let me go up
town with him he always made me a present, which
was sure to be more valuable, more expensive, than
those little gifts at home, bestowed as rewards of
various merits and sacrifices related to that institution
of the afternoon nap, and forthcoming if he
got through the nap satisfactorily, that is, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
being awakened. They consisted of mere money, the
little five or ten cent notes of green scrip; &#8220;shin-plasters&#8221;
they were called, I believe, in those days.</p>

<p>When my grandfather had rearranged his toilet,
combing his thick white hair and then immediately
running his fingers through it to rumple it up and
give him a savage aspect, we set forth.</p>

<p>He wore broad polished shoes, low, and fastened
with buckles, and against the black of his attire
his stiffly starched, immaculate white waistcoat was
conspicuous. Only a few of its lower buttons of
pearl were fastened; above that it was open, and
from one of the buttonholes, the second from the
top, his long gold watch-chain hung from its large
gold hook. The black cravat was not hidden by
his white beard, which he did not wear as long as
many Ohio gentlemen of that day, and he was
crowned by a large Panama hat, yellowed by years
of summer service, and bisected by a ridge that began
at the middle of the broad brim directly in front,
ran back, climbed and surmounted the large high
crown, and then, descending, ended its impressive
career at the middle of the broad brim behind.</p>

<p>I was walking on his left hand, near the fence,
but as we entered the shade of the elms and shrubbery
of the Swedenborgian churchyard, I went
around to his other side, because a ghost dwelt in
the Swedenborgian churchyard. My cousin had
pointed it out to me, and once I had seen it distinctly.</p>

<p>The precaution was unnecessary, for I had long
known my grandfather for a brave man. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
been a soldier, and many persons in Urbana still saluted
him as major, though at that time he was
mayor; going up town, in fact, meant to go to the
town hall before going anywhere else. In the shade
he removed his hat, and taking out a large silk
handkerchief, passed it several times over his red,
perspiring face.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, a hot afternoon, even for
an August afternoon in Ohio, and it was the hottest
hour of the afternoon. Main Street, when we
turned into it presently, was deserted, and wore an
unreal appearance, like the street of the dead
town that was painted on the scene at the &#8220;opera-house.&#8221;
Far to the south it stretched its interminable
length in white dust, until its trees came together
in that mysterious distance where the fairgrounds
were, and to the north its vista was closed
by the bronze figure of the cavalryman standing
on his pedestal in the Square, his head bowed in sad
meditation, one gauntleted hand resting on his hip,
the other on his saber-hilt. Out over the thick dust
of the street the heat quivered and vibrated, and
if you squinted in the sun at the cavalryman, he
seemed to move, to tremble, in the shimmer of that
choking atmosphere.</p>

<p>The town hall stood in Market Square; for, in
addition to <i>the</i> Square, where the bronze cavalryman
stood on his pedestal, there was Market Square,
the day of civic centers not having dawned on Urbana
in that time, nor, doubtless, in this.</p>

<p>Market Square was not a square, however, but
a parallelogram, and on one side of it, fronting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Main Street, was the town hall, a low building of
brick, representing in itself an amazing unity of
municipal functions&mdash;the germ of the group plan,
no doubt, and, after all, in its little way, a civic
center indeed. For there, in an auditorium, plays
were staged before a populace innocent of the fact
that it had a municipal theater, and in another room
the city council sat, with representatives from
Lighttown, and Gooseville, and Guinea, and the
other <i>faubourgs</i> of our little municipality. Under
that long low roof, too, were the &#8220;calaboose&#8221; and
the headquarters of the fire department. Back of
these the structure sloped away into a market-house
of some sort, with a public scales, and broad, low,
overhanging eaves, in the shade of which firemen,
and the city marshal, and other officials, in the dim
retrospect, seem to have devoted their leisure to the
game of checkers.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of Market Square there was
a line of brick buildings, painted once, perhaps, and
now of a faint pink or cerise which certain of the
higher and more artistic grades of calcimining assume,
and there seems to have been a series, almost
interminable, of small saloons&mdash;declining and fading
away somewhere to the east, in the dark purlieus of
Guinea.</p>

<p>Here, along this line of saloons, if it was a line
of saloons, or, if it was not, along the side of the
principal saloon which in those wet days commanded
that corner, there were always several carts, driven
by Irishmen from Lighttown, smoking short clay
pipes, and two-wheeled drays driven by negroes from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Guinea or Gooseville. These negro drivers were
burly men with shining black skins and gleaming
eyes and teeth, whose merry laughter was almost belied
by the ferocious, brutal whips they carried&mdash;whips
precisely like that <i>Simon Legree</i> had wielded
in the play in the theater just across the Square,
now, by a stroke of poetic justice, in the hands of
<i>Uncle Tom</i> himself. But on this day the firemen
were not to be seen under the eaves of the market-house;
their checker-boards were quite abandoned.
The mules between the shafts of these two-wheeled
drays hung their heads and their long ears drooped
under the heat, and their black masters were curled
up on the sidewalk against the wall of the saloon,
asleep. The Irishmen were nowhere to be seen, and
Market Square was empty, deserted, and sprawled
there reflecting the light in a blinding way, while
from the yellow, dusty level of its cobbled surface
rose, wave on wave, palpably, that trembling, shimmering,
vibrating heat. And yet, there was one
waking, living thing in sight. There, out in the middle
of the Square he stood, a dusty, drab figure, with
an old felt hat on a head that must have ached and
throbbed in that implacable heat, with a mass of
rags upon him, his frayed trousers gathered at his
ankles and bound about by irons, and a ball and
chain to bind him to that spot. He had a broom in
his hands, and was aimlessly making a little smudge
of dust, doing his part in the observance of an old,
cruel, and hideous superstition.</p>

<p>I knew, of course, that he was a prisoner. Usually
there were three or four, sometimes half a dozen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
such as he. They were the chain-gang, and they
were Bad&mdash;made so by Rum. I knew that they
were brought out of the calaboose, that damp, dark
place under the roof of the market-house, somewhere
between the office of the mayor and the headquarters
of the fire department; and glimpses were to be
caught now and then of their faces pressed against
those bars.</p>

<p>When, under the shade of the broad eaves, we
were about to enter the mayor&#8217;s office, my grandfather
motioned to the prisoner out there in the
center of the Square, who with a new alacrity
dropped his broom, picked up his ball, and lugging
it in his arms, came up close to us, so very close
that I could see the sweat that drenched his forehead,
stood in great beads on his upper lip, matted
the hair on his forearms, stained with dark splashes
his old shirt, and glistened on his throat and breast,
burned red by the sun. He dropped his ball,
took off that rag of a hat, raised eyelids that
were powdered with dust, and looked at my grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many days did I give you?&#8221; my grandfather
asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen, your honor,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three days, your honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the only one in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>My grandfather paused and looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty hot out there, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked my grandfather.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>The prisoner smiled, a smile exactly like that
anyone would have for such a question, but the
smile flickered from his face, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>My grandfather looked out over the Square and
up and down. There was no one anywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, come on into the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner picked up his ball, and followed my
grandfather into the mayor&#8217;s office. My grandfather
went to a desk, drew out a drawer, fumbled in it,
found a key, and with this he stooped and unlocked
the irons on the prisoner&#8217;s ankles. But he did not
remove the irons&mdash;he seated himself in the large
chair, and leaned comfortably against its squeaking
cane back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; my grandfather said, &#8220;you go out there
in the Square&mdash;be careful not to knock the leg irons
off as you go,&mdash;and you sweep around for a little
while, and when the coast is clear you kick them
off and light out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The creature in the drab rags looked at my
grandfather a moment, opened his lips, closed them,
swallowed, and then....</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better hurry,&#8221; said my grandfather, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what minute the marshal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner gathered up his ball, hugged it carefully,
almost tenderly, in his arms, and, with infinity
delicacy as to the irons on his feet, he shuffled carefully,
yet somehow swiftly out. I saw him an instant
in the brilliant glittering sunlight framed by
the door; he looked back, and then he disappeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
leaving only the blank surface of the cobblestones
with the heat trembling over them.</p>

<p>My grandfather put on his glasses, turned to his
desk, and took up some papers there. And I waited,
in the still, hot room. The minutes were ticked
off by the clock. I wondered at each loud tick if
it was the minute in which it would be proper for
the prisoner to kick off those irons from his ankles
and start to run. And then, after a few minutes,
a man appeared in the doorway, and said breathlessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, he has escaped!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Uncle John, a brother of my grandfather,
one of the Brands of Kentucky, then on a visit&mdash;one
of those long visits by which he and my grandfather
sought to make up the large arrears of the
differences, the divisions, and the separations of the
great war. He was nearly of my grandfather&#8217;s
age, and like him a large man, with a white though
longer beard. At his entrance my grandfather did
not turn, nor speak, and Uncle John Brand cried
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, he&#8217;s gone, I tell you; he&#8217;s getting
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>My grandfather looked up then from his papers
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;John, you&#8217;d better come in out of that heat and
sit down. You&#8217;re excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s getting away, I tell you! Don&#8217;t you
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is getting away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that prisoner.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;What prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The prisoner out there in the Square. He has
escaped! He&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just saw him running down Main Street like
a streak of lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>My grandfather took out his silk handkerchief,
passed it over his brow, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;To think of anyone running on a day like this!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Uncle John Brand stood there and gazed at
his brother with an expression of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you understand,&#8221; he said, speaking in
an intense tone, as if somehow to impress my grandfather
with the importance of this event in society,
&#8220;can&#8217;t you understand that the prisoner out there
in the Square has broken away, has escaped, and at
this minute is running down Main Street, and that
he&#8217;s getting farther and farther away with each
moment that you sit there?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had a vivid picture of the man running with long
strides, in the soft dust of Main Street; he must
even then, I fancied, be far down the street; he
must indeed be down by Bailey&#8217;s, and perhaps
Bailey&#8217;s dog was rushing out at him, barking. And
I hoped he would run faster, and faster, and get
away, though I felt it was wrong to hope this.
Uncle John Brand seemed to be right; though I
did not like him as I liked my grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could he get away?&#8221; my grandfather
was asking. &#8220;He was in irons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He got the irons off somehow,&#8221; Uncle John
Brand said, exasperated; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
didn&#8217;t stop to explain!&#8221; He found a relief in this
fine sarcasm, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to do anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said my grandfather, with an irresolution
quite uncommon in him, &#8220;I suppose I really
ought to do something. But I don&#8217;t know just what
to do.&#8221; He sat up, and looked about all over the
room. &#8220;You don&#8217;t see the marshal, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle John Brand was looking at him now in
disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look outside there, will you, John,&#8221; my
grandfather went on, &#8220;and see if you can find him?
If you do, send him in, and I&#8217;ll speak to him and
have him go after the prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle John Brand of Kentucky stood a moment
in the doorway, finding no words with which to express
himself, and then went out. And when he
had gone my grandfather leaned back in his chair
and laughed and laughed; laughed until his ruddy
face became much redder than it was even from the
heat of that day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>


<p>Now that I have set down, with such particularity,
an incident which I could not wholly understand
nor reconcile with the established order of things
until many years after, I am not so sure after all
that I witnessed it in that Urbana of reality; it
may have been in that Urbana of the memory,
wherein related scenes and incidents have coalesced
with the witnessed event, or in that Macochee of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
certain of my attempts in fiction, though I have always
hoped that the fiction was the essential reality
of life, and have tried to make it so.</p>

<p>I am certain, however, that the incident as related
is entirely authentic, for I have recently made inquiries
and established it beyond a reasonable doubt,
as the lawyers say, in all its details as here given. I
say in all its details, save possibly as to that of my
own corporeal presence on the scene, at the actual
moment of the occurrence. Only the other day I
asked a favorite aunt of mine, and she remembered
the incident perfectly, and many another similar
to it. &#8220;It was just like him,&#8221; she added, with a
dubious, though tolerant fondness. But when, like
the insistent, questioning child in one of Riley&#8217;s
Hoosier poems, I asked her if I had been there, she
said she could not remember.</p>

<p>But whether I was there in the flesh or not, or
whether the whole reality of that scene, so poignant,
and insistent, and indelible, with its denial of the
grounds of authority, its challenge to the bases of
society, its shock to the orthodox mind (like that
of John Brand of Kentucky, a strict constructionist,
who believed in the old Constitution, and even
then, in slavery), remains in my memory as the result
of one of those tricks of a mind that has always
dramatized scenes for its own amusement, I was
there in spirit, and, indeed, at many another scene
in the life of Joseph Carter Brand, whose name my
mother gave me as a good heritage. Whatever the
bald and banal physical fact may have been, I was
either present at the actual or in imagination at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
described scene to such purpose that from it I derived
an impression never to be erased from my
mind.</p>

<p>It is not given to all of us to say with such particularity
and emphasis, just what we learned from
each person who has touched our existences and
affected the trend of our lives, as it was given to
Marcus Aurelius, for instance, so that one may say
that from Rusticus one received this impression, or
that from Apollonius one learned this and from
Alexander the Platonic that; we must rather ascribe
our little store of knowledge generally to the gods.
But I am sure that no one was ever long with Joseph
Carter Brand, or came to know him well, without
learning that rarest and most beautiful of all
the graces or of all the virtues&mdash;Pity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He, too, had tears for all souls in trouble</div>
<div class="verse">Here, and in hell.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps it is not so much pity as sympathy that
I mean, but whether it was pity or sympathy, it
was that divine quality in man which enables him
to imagine the sorrows of others, to understand
what they feel, to suffer with them; in a word, the
ability to put himself in the other fellow&#8217;s place&mdash;the
hallmark, I believe, of true culture, far more
than any degree or doctor&#8217;s hood could possibly be.</p>

<p>It may have been some such feeling as this for
the negroes that led him, when a young man in Kentucky,
to renounce a patrimony of slaves and come
north. It was not, to be sure, a very large patrimony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
for his father was a farmer in a rather small
way in Bourbon County, and owned a few slaves, but
whatever the motive, he refused to own human chattels
and left Bourbon County, where his branch of
the Brands had lived since their emigration from
Virginia, to which colony, so long before, their original
had come as a Jacobite exile from Forfarshire
in Scotland.</p>

<p>My grandfather came north into Ohio and Champaign
County, and he had not been there very long
before he went back to Virginia and married Lavina
Talbott, and when they went to live on the farm he
called &#8220;Pretty Prairie,&#8221; he soon found himself deep
in Ohio politics, as it seems the fate of most Ohioans
to be, and continued in that element all his life. He
had his political principles from Henry Clay,&mdash;he
had been to Ashland and had known the family,&mdash;and
he was elected as a Whig to the legislature in
1842 and to the State Senate of Ohio in 1854. There
he learned to know and to admire Salmon P. Chase,
then governor of Ohio, and it was not long until
he was in the Abolitionist movement, and he got into
it so deeply that nothing less than the Civil War
could ever have got him out, for he was in open
defiance, most of the time, to the Fugitive Slave
Law.</p>

<p>One of the accomplishments in which he took
pride, perhaps next to his ability as a horseman,
was his skill with the rifle, acquired in Kentucky at
the expense of squirrels in the tops of tall trees (he
could snuff a candle with a rifle), and this ability
he placed at the service of a negro named Ad White,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
who had run away from his master in the South,
and was hidden in a corn-crib near Urbana when
overtaken by United States marshals from Cincinnati.
The negro was armed, and was defending
himself, when my grandfather and his friend Ichabod
Corwin, of a name tolerably well known in Ohio history,
went to his assistance, and drove the marshals
off by the hot fire of their rifles. The marshals retreated,
and came up later with reinforcements,
strong enough to overpower Judge Corwin and my
grandfather, but the negro had escaped.</p>

<p>The scrape was an expensive one; there were
proceedings against them in the United States
court in Cincinnati, and they only got out of it
years after when the Fugitive Slave Law was rapidly
becoming no law, and Ad White could live near Urbana
in peace during a long life, and be pointed
out as an interesting relic of the great conflict.</p>

<p>This adventure befell my grandfather in 1858,
when he had been a Republican for two years, having
been a delegate to the first convention of the
party in 1856, the one that met in Pittsburgh, before
the nominating convention which named Fr&eacute;mont had
met in Philadelphia. He had attended that convention
with Cassius M. Clay of Kentucky, and shared
quarters with him at the hotel.</p>

<p>In 1908, in the Coliseum at Chicago, when the
Republican National Convention was in session,
there were conducted to the stage one morning, and
introduced to the delegates, two old gentlemen who
had been delegates to that first convention of the
party, and after they had been presented and duly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
celebrated by the chairman and cheered by the delegates
they were assiduously given seats in large
chairs, and there, throughout the session, side by
side they sat, their hands clasped over the crooks of
their heavy canes, their white old heads unsteady,
peering out in a certain purblind, bewildered, aged
way over that mighty assembly of the power and the
wealth, the respectability and the authority, of the
nation&mdash;far other than that revolutionary gathering
they had attended half a century before!</p>

<p>All through the session, now and then, I would
look at them; there was a certain indefinable pathos
in them, they sat so still, they were so old, there
was in their attitude the acquiescence of age&mdash;and
I would recall my grandfather&#8217;s stories of the days
when they were the force in the Republic, and the
runaway &#8220;niggers,&#8221; and the rifles, and the great
blazing up of liberty in the land, and it seemed to me
that Time, or what Thomas Hardy calls the Ironic
Spirit, or perhaps it was only the politicians who
were managing the convention, had played some
grotesque, stupendous joke on those patriarchs. Did
their old eyes, gazing so strangely on that scene,
behold its implications? Did they descry the guide-post
that told them how far away they really were
from that first convention and its ideals?</p>

<p>But whatever the reflections of those two aboriginal
Republicans, or whatever emotions or speculations
they may have inspired in those who saw them,&mdash;the
torch of liberty being ever brandished somewhere
in this world and tossed from hand to hand,&mdash;they
had done their part in their day, and might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
presumably be allowed to look on at the antics of
men wherever they chose, in peace. They had
known Lincoln, no inconsiderable distinction in
itself!</p>

<p>Out of that first convention my grandfather, like
them, had gone, and he had done his part to help
elect Lincoln after Lincoln had defeated Chase in
the Chicago convention of 1860, and had been nominated
for the presidency. And then, with his man
elected, my grandfather had gone into the war that
broke upon the land.</p>

<p>He went in with the 66th Ohio Volunteer Infantry,
a regiment which he was commissioned by Governor
Dennison to recruit at Urbana, and when it
was marshaled in camp near Urbana its command
was offered him, an honor and a responsibility he declined
because, he said, he knew nothing of the art
of war, if it is an art, or of its science, if it is a
science, and so was content with the shoulder-straps
of a captain. One of his sons, a lieutenant in the
regular army, was already at the front with his
regiment, and another son was a captain in the 66th,
and later on, when my grandfather had been transferred
to the Department of Subsistence, he took
his youngest son with him in the capacity of a
clerk, so that the men of his family were away to
the war for those four years, and the women remained
behind, making housewives and scraping lint,
and watching, and waiting, and praying, and enduring
all those hardships and making all those
sacrifices which are so lauded by the poetic and the
sentimental and yet are not enough to entitle them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to a voice in that government in whose cause they
are made.</p>

<p>The situation was made all the more poignant
because the great issue had separated the family,
and there were brothers and cousins on the other
side, though one of these, in the person of Aunt Lucretia,
chose that inauspicious time to come over
from the other side all the way from Virginia, to
pay a visit, and celebrated the report of a Confederate
victory by parading up town with a butternut
badge on her bosom. She sailed several times about
the Square, with her head held high and her crinolines
rustling and standing out, and her butternut
badge in evidence, and was rescued by my grandmother,
who, hearing of her temerity, went up town
in desperation and in fear that she might arrive
too late. It was a story I was fond of hearing,
and as I pictured the lively scene I always had the
statue of the cavalryman as a figure in the picture&mdash;though
of course the statue could not have been
in existence during the war, since it was erected as
a memorial to the 66th and a monument to its fallen
heroes and their deeds. The cavalryman, an officer
wearing a romantic cloak and the old plumed hat
of the military fashion of that date, and leaning on
his saber in a gloomy way, I always thought was a
figure of my uncle, that Captain Brand who went
out with the 66th, just as I thought for a long time
that the Civil War was practically fought out on
the northern side by the 66th, which was not so
strange perhaps, since nearly every family in Urbana
had been represented in the regiment, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
all talked of little else than the war for many years.
They called the 66th the &#8220;Bloody Sixty-sixth,&#8221; a
name I have since heard applied to other regiments,
but the honorable epithet was not undeserved by that
legion, for it had a long and most gallant record,
beginning with the Army of the Potomac and fighting
in all that army&#8217;s battles until after Gettysburg,
and then with the 11th and 12th corps it was transferred,
under Hooker, to the Army of the Tennessee,
at Chattanooga, in time for Lookout Mountain and
Missionary Ridge, after which it went with Sherman
to the sea, and thus completed the circuit of the
Confederacy.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>

<p>My grandfather, however, did not go with his
regiment to the West. He had been transferred to
the Commissary Department, and he remained with
the Army of the Potomac until the close of the war,
and it was on some detail connected with his duties
in that department that, in 1865, he went into Washington
and had the interview with President Lincoln
I so much liked to hear him tell about. It was not
in the course of his military duty that he went to
see the Commander-in-Chief; whatever those duties
were they were quickly discharged at the War Department,
so that, in the hours of freedom remaining
to him before he went back to the front, he did
what everyone likes to do in Washington,&mdash;he went
to see the President. But he went in no military
capacity; he went rather in that political capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
he so much preferred to the military, and he went as
to the chief he had so long known and loved and
followed.</p>

<p>It would be his old friend Chase who presented
him to the President, but their conversation was
soon interrupted by the entrance of an aide who
announced the arrival in the White House grounds
of an Indiana regiment passing through Washington,
which, as seems to have been the case with most
regiments passing through the Capital, demanded a
speech from the President. And Lincoln complied,
and as he arose to go out he asked my grandfather
to accompany him, and they continued their talk on
the way. But when they stood in the White House
portico, and the regiment beheld the President and
saluted him with its lifted cheer, the aide stepped
to my grandfather&#8217;s side, and much to his chagrin&mdash;for
he had been held by the President while he
finished a story&mdash;told him that it would be necessary
for him to drop a few paces to the rear. It
was a little <i>contretemps</i> that embarrassed my grandfather,
but Lincoln, with his fine and delicate perceptions,
divined the whole situation, and met it
with that kindness which was so great a part of
the humor and humanness in him, by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Mr. Brand, they might not know which
was the President.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long after that he was at Appomattox
and the first to issue rations to the hungry Confederates
who had just surrendered, and no act of
his life gave him quite as much satisfaction as to
have been the first to pour his whole supply of hardtack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
into the blankets of those whom still and always
he remembered as of his own blood. And that
done, after they had ridden into Richmond, he was
relieved and was soon back in Washington calling
on Chase again. Chase asked him what he could
do for him, and my grandfather said there was but
one thing in the world he wanted: namely, to go
home; and a request so simple was granted with
that alacrity with which politicians grant requests
that, in their scope, fall so short of what
might have been expected. But it was not long until
Chase&#8217;s influence was requested in a more substantial
matter, and in 1870 my grandfather, with his wife
and two younger daughters, was on his way across
the Atlantic to Nuremberg, where President Grant
had appointed him consul.</p>

<p>It was not, of course, until after his return from
the foreign experience that my conscious acquaintance
with him began. But when they returned and
opened the old house, and filled it with the spoil of
their European travel,&mdash;some wonderful mahogany
furniture and Dresden china, and other objects of
far more delight to us children,&mdash;he and I began a
friendship which lasted until his death, and was
marred by no misunderstanding, except, perhaps,
as to the number of hours his saddle-horse should
be ridden on the gallop, and the German he wished
me to read to him out of the little black-bound
volumes of Schiller and Goethe, which for years
were his companions. He held, no doubt with some
show of reason on his side, that if he could master
the language after he was sixty, I might learn at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
least to read it before I was sixteen. The task had
its discouragements, not lightened, even in after
years, when I read in their famous and delightful
correspondence Carlyle&#8217;s advice to Emerson to possess
himself of the German language; it could be
done, wrote Carlyle, in six weeks! But, like Emerson,
I was afflicted with the postponement and debility
of the blond constitution, and I observed that,
except in great moments of unappreciated sacrifice,
my grandfather preferred to read his German himself
rather than to listen to my renditions.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the house as the old house, and I
do that as viewing it from the point of disadvantage
of the years that have gone since it grew out
of that haze and mist and darkness of early recollections
into a place that was ablaze with light at
evening and full of the constant wonder and delight
of the company of a large family. It was, indeed,
an old house then, with a high-gabled roof at
one wing, that made an attic which we called, with
a sense of its mystery, the &#8220;dark room,&#8221;&mdash;a room,
however, not so dark that I could not see to read
the old bound volumes of a newspaper an uncle had
once edited;&mdash;one could lie under the little gable
windows and pore over the immense quartos, or more
than quartos, and exercise the imagination by reading
of some long dead event, and, with a great effort,
project one&#8217;s self back to that time, and pretend
to read with none other than its contemporary
impressions.</p>

<p>The cellar of the house was not so interesting,
though it was mysterious, and far more terrifying.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
There was a vast fireplace in the cellar, in which,
as Jane, the old colored woman who was sometimes
a cook and sometimes a nurse, once solemnly told
my cousin and me, the devil dwelt, so that I visited
it only once, and there so plainly saw the ugly horns
of that dark deity that we fled upstairs and into
the sunlight again. It may have been that the crane
and the andirons of the old fireplace helped out
the impression, though after the original suggestion
little was required to strengthen it, and we
never went down there again, except to lure a
younger cousin as far as the door to shudder in the
awful pleasure of witnessing her fear.</p>

<p>This gabled wing had been the original house,
and additions had been built to it in two directions,
with a wide hall, somewhat after the southern fashion
in which so many houses in that part of Ohio were
built in those days.</p>

<p>It seems larger in the retrospect than it is in
the reality, and I am not endowing it with the
spaciousness of a mansion; it was, in fact, a modest
dwelling of a dozen rooms, with an atmosphere that
was imparted to it by the furniture that had been
brought back from Europe, and the personality that
filled it.</p>

<p>My grandfather conducted his establishment on
a scale of prodigality that had a certain patriarchal
air; he had a large family, and he loved to have
them all about him, and in the evenings they gathered
there at the piano they had bought in Berlin,
and when the candles in their curious brass sconces
had been lighted, there was music, for the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
family possessed some of that talent which, as President
Eliot rightly declares in his lecture on &#8220;The
Happy Life,&#8221; contributes so much real pleasure.
My grandfather did not himself sing; or, at
least, he sang rarely, and then only one or two
Scotch songs, but when he could be induced to
do this, the event took on the festal air of a celebration.</p>

<p>His two younger daughters had been educated
in music in Germany, and there was something more
of music in the house than the mere classic portraits
of Mozart and Beethoven which hung on the
wall near the painting of the old castle at Nuremberg.
They played duets, and once, at least, at a
recital given in the town, we achieved the distinction
of a number played on two pianos by my mother
and her three sisters.</p>

<p>The May festivals in &#8220;the City,&#8221; as we called Cincinnati
in those days, were a part of existence, and
my first excursion into the larger world was when
my father took me to Cincinnati to hear Theodore
Thomas&#8217;s Orchestra, which proved to be an excursion
not only into a larger world, but eventually
into a larger life,&mdash;that life of music, that life of a
love of all the arts, which provides a consolation
that would be complete could I but express myself
in any one of them. I did, indeed, attempt some
expression of the joys of that experience, for with
more pretension than I could dare to-day, I wrote
a composition, or paper, on Music which was printed
in a child&#8217;s publication, and won for me a little
prize. It was twenty-two years before I was able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
again to have any writing of mine accepted and
published by a magazine.</p>

<p>Urbana in those days was not without its atmosphere
of culture, influenced in a degree by the
presence of the Urbana University, a Swedenborgian
college which in the days before the war had
flourished, because so many of its students came
from the southern states. It declined after the
war, but even after that event, the presence of so
many persons of the Swedenborgian persuasion,
with their gentle manners and intellectual appreciation,
kept the traditions alive, and the college
itself continued, though not so flourishingly, on its
endowed foundation.</p>

<p>One of the tutors in it was a young, brown-haired
man who several times a day passed by my grandfather&#8217;s
home on his way to and from his classes,
whom afterwards I came to admire for those writings
to which was signed the name of Hjalmar Hjorth
Boyesen. He did not remain long in Urbana, not
longer it seems than he could help, and to judge
from some of his pictures of various phases of its
life, he did not like the town as well as the Urbana
folk themselves liked it. It was a rather self-sufficient
town, I fancy, and it cared so little for change
that it has scarcely changed at all, save as one misses
the faces and the forms one used to see there in
other days. It was the home of the distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
family, and the birthplace, too, of John Quincy
Adams Ward, the sculptor, and the possession of
a personality in itself distinguishes a town.</p>

<p>I was walking with my father across Market
Square not long ago; it had shrunk in size and
seemed little and mean and sordid, despite the new
city hall that has replaced the old, and there was
no miserable prisoner idly sweeping the cobblestones,
though the negro drivers with their bull whips were
snoozing there as formerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been there ever since eighteen sixty-six,&#8221;
said my father, who had gone there in the
year he had mentioned on his coming out of college.</p>

<p>His home was in Piqua, a town not far away,
where his father had retired to rest after his lifelong
labors on a farm he had himself &#8220;cleared&#8221; in Montgomery
County many years before. This paternal
grandfather was a large, gaunt, silent man, who
spoke little, and then mostly in a sardonic humor,
as when, during that awful pioneer work of felling
a forest to make a little plantation, he said to his
grown sons who were helping to clear away the underbrush
of a walnut wood:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, what little you cut, pile here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few other of his sayings have been preserved, and
it may be that he has left behind an impression that
he never talked at all because he never talked politics,
and not to do that in Ohio dooms one to a
silence almost perpetual. He had once been a Democrat,
and had participated with such enthusiasm in
the campaign of 1856 that he had kept his horses&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
tails and manes braided for a month that they
might roll forth in noble curls when they were loosened,
and the horses harnessed to a carriage containing
four veterans of the Revolution, who were to
be thus splendidly drawn to the raising of a tall
hickory pole in honor of James Buchanan, that year
a candidate for president. But the old diplomatist
made such a miserable weakling failure of his
administration that his Piqua partizan became
disgusted and renounced forever his interest in
political affairs, and, like Henry I., never smiled
again.</p>

<p>But my Grandfather Brand, when he was not
talking about poetry or the war, was talking about
politics; sometimes world politics, for he was interested
in that; sometimes European politics, which
he had followed ever since in Paris he had witnessed
the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, or national
politics, or state politics, or, in default of a
larger interest, local politics, which in Ohio, as no
doubt elsewhere, sometimes looms largest and most
important of all, because, perhaps, as De Tocqueville
says, local assemblies constitute the strength of
free institutions.</p>

<p>My grandfather was then, at the time of which
I am thinking even if I am not very specifically
writing about it, mayor&mdash;and continued to be mayor
for four terms. It was an office that was suited, no
doubt, to the leisure of his retirement, and while it
gave him the feeling of being occupied in public affairs,
it nevertheless left him opportunities enough
for his German poets, and for his horses and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
farm out at Cable, and the strawberries he was beginning
to cultivate with the enthusiasm of an amateur.</p>

<p>In such an atmosphere as that in the Ohio of those
days it was natural to be a Republican; it was more
than that, it was inevitable that one should be a Republican;
it was not a matter of intellectual choice,
it was a process of biological selection. The Republican
party was not a faction, not a group, not a
wing, it was an institution like those Emerson speaks
of in his essay on Politics, rooted like oak-trees in
the center around which men group themselves as
best they can. It was a fundamental and self-evident
thing, like life, and liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, or like the flag, or the federal judiciary.
It was elemental, like gravity, the sun, the stars, the
ocean. It was merely a synonym for patriotism, another
name for the nation. One became, in Urbana
and in Ohio for many years, a Republican just as the
Eskimo dons fur clothes. It was inconceivable that
any self-respecting person should be a Democrat.
There were, perhaps, Democrats in Lighttown; but
then there were rebels in Alabama, and in the Ku-klux
Klan, about which we read in the evening, in
the Cincinnati <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>One of the perplexing and confounding anomalies
of existence was the fact that our neighbor, Mr.
L&mdash;&mdash;, was a Democrat. That fact perhaps explained
to me why he walked so modestly, so unobtrusively,
in the shade, so close to the picket fences
of Reynolds Street, with his head bowed. I supposed that,
being a Democrat, it was only natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
for him to slink along. He was a lawyer and a
gentleman; my grandfather spoke with him, but
from my mind I could never banish the fact that
he was a Democrat, and to explain his bent, thoughtful
attitude I imagined another reason than the
fact that he was a meditative, studious man.</p>

<p>Lawyers, of course, were Republicans, else how
could they deliver patriotic addresses on Decoration
Day and at the reunions of the 66th regiment?
It was natural for a young man to be a lawyer, then
to be elected prosecuting attorney, then to go to the
legislature, then to congress, then&mdash;governor, senator,
president. They could not, of course, go any
more to war and fight for liberty; that distinction
was no longer, unhappily, possible, but they could
be Republicans. The Republican party had saved
the Union, won liberty for all men, and there was
nothing left for the patriotic to do but to extol that
party, and to see to it that its members held office
under the government.</p>

<p>In those days the party had many leaders in
Ohio who had served the nation in military or civil
capacity during the great crisis; scarcely a county
that had not some colonel or general whose personality
impressed the popular imagination; they
were looked up to, and revered, and in the political
campaigns their faces, pale or red in the flare of
the torches of those vast and tumultuous processions
that still staged the political contest in the
terms of war, looked down from the festooned platforms
in every public square. And yet they were
already remote, statuesque, oracular, and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the reverent sense that somehow placed them in the
ideal past, whose problems had all been happily
solved, rather than in the real present.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>
</div>


<p>But up in the northwestern part of the state,
still referred to, even in days so late as those, with
something of the humorous contempt that attached
to the term, as the Black Swamp, there had risen
a young, fiery, and romantic figure who ignored the
past and flung himself with fierce ardor into a new
campaign for liberty. His words fell strangely on
ears that were accustomed to the reassurance that
liberty was at last conquered, and his doctrines perplexed
and irritated minds that had sunk into the
shallow optimism of a belief that there were no more
liberations needed in the world. It was not a new
cry, indeed, that he raised, but an old one thought
to have been stilled, and the standard he lifted in
the Black Swamp was looked upon by many Ohioans
as much askance as though it were another secession
flag of stars and bars. Indeed, it had long
been associated with the cause of the conquered
South, because that section, by reason of its economic
conditions, had long espoused the principle of
Free Trade.</p>

<p>This young man was Frank Hunt Hurd, then
the congressman from the Toledo district, and in
that city, where my father was the pastor of a
church, he had won many followers and adherents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
though not enough to keep him continually in his
seat in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>He served for several alternate terms, the interims
being filled by some orthodox nonentity, who
was so speedily forgotten that there must have been
an impression that for years our district was represented
by this one man.</p>

<p>I had heard of him with that dim sense of his
position which a boy has of any public character,
but I had a real vivid conception of him after that
Fourth of July when, during a citizens&#8217; celebration
which must have been so far patriotic as to forget,
for a time, partizanism, and to remember patriotism
sufficiently to include the Democrats, I saw
him conducted to the platform by our distinguished
citizen, David R. Locke, whom the world knew as
&#8220;Petroleum V. Nasby.&#8221;</p>

<p>He delivered a patriotic oration, and anyone,&mdash;even
though he were but a wondering boy quite by
chance in attendance, standing on the outskirts of
the crowd, following some whim which for a while
kept him from his sports,&mdash;anyone who ever heard
Frank Hurd deliver an oration never forgot it afterward.</p>

<p>I have no idea now what it was he said, perhaps
I had as little then, but his black hair, his handsome
face, his beautiful voice, and the majestic music
of his rolling phrases were wholly and completely
charming. He was explicitly an orator, a
student of the great art, and he formed his orations
on the ancient Greek models, writing them out with
exordium, proposition, and peroration, and while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
did not perhaps exactly commit them to memory,
he, nevertheless, in the process of preparing them,
so completely possessed himself of them that he
poured forth his polished sentences without a flaw.</p>

<p>His speech on Free Trade, delivered in the House
of Representatives, February 18, 1881, remains the
classic on that subject, ranking with Henry Clay&#8217;s
speech on &#8220;The American System,&#8221; delivered in the
Senate in 1832. In that address Frank Hurd began
with the phrase, &#8220;The tariff is a tax,&#8221; which acquired
much currency years after when Grover
Cleveland used it.</p>

<p>Everyone, or nearly everyone, told me of course
that Frank Hurd was wrong, if he was not, indeed,
wicked, and the subject possessed a kind of fascination
for me. In thinking of it, or in trying to think
of it, I only perplexed myself more deeply, until at
last I reached the formidable, the momentous decision
of taking my perplexities to Frank Hurd himself,
and of laying them before him.</p>

<p>I was by this time a youth of eighteen, and in
the summer when he had come home from Washington
I somehow found courage enough to go to
the hotel where he lived, and to inquire for him. He
was there in the lobby, standing by the cigar-stand,
talking to some men, and I hung on the outskirts of
the little group until it broke up, and then the
fear I had felt vanished when he turned and smiled
upon me. I told him that I wished to know about
Free Trade, and since there was nothing he liked
better to talk about, and too, since there were few
who could talk better about anything than he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
talk about the tariff, we sat in the big leather chairs
while he discoursed simply on the subject. It was
the first at several of these conversations, or lessons,
which we had in the big leather chairs in the
lobby of the old Boody House, and it was not long
until I was able, with a solemn pride, to announce
at home that I was a Free-Trader and a Democrat.</p>

<p>It could hardly have been worse had I announced
that I had been visiting Ingersoll, and was an atheist.
Cleveland was president, and in time he sent
his famous tariff reform message to Congress, and
though I could not vote, I was preparing to give
him my moral support, to wear his badge, and even,
if I could do no more, to refuse to march in the Republican
processions with the club of young men
and boys organized in our neighborhood.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life I went on my vacation
trip to Urbana that summer with reluctance,
for the first time in my life I shrank from seeing
my grandfather. The wide front door opened, and
from the heat without to the dark and cool interior
of the hall I stepped; I prolonged the preliminaries,
I went through the familiar apartments, and out
into the garden to see how it grew that summer,
and down to the stable to see the horses; but the
inevitable hour drew on, and at last, with all the
trivial things said, all the personal questions asked,
we sat in the living-room, cool in the half-light produced
by its drawn shades, the soft air of summer
blowing through it, the odd old Nuremberg furniture,
the painting of the Nuremberg castle presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
to my grandfather by the American artist whom he
had rescued from a scrape, the tall pier glass, with
the little vase of flowers on its marble base, and my
grandfather in his large chair, his white waistcoat
half unbuttoned and one side sagging with the weight
of the heavy watch-chain that descended from its
large hook, his white beard trimmed a little more
closely, his white hair bristling as aggressively as
ever&mdash;all the same, all as of old, like the reminders of
the old life and all its traditions now to be broken
and rendered forever and tragically different from
all it had been and meant. He sat there looking at
me, the blue eyes twinkling under their shaggy
brows, and stretched forth his long white hand in
the odd gesture with which he began his conversations.
Conversations with him, it suddenly developed,
were not easy to sustain; he pursued the
Socratic method. If you disagreed with him, he
lifted three fingers toward you, whether in menace
or in benediction it was difficult at times to determine,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me instruct you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know why Napoleon III. lost the battle
of Sedan?&#8221; he might abruptly inquire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; you were expected to say. (You always
addressed him as &#8220;sir.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me instruct you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who was the greatest English
poet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; you would say, or, perhaps, in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
days you might venture, &#8220;Was it Shakespeare,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he would look at you and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me instruct you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This afternoon then, after I had inspected the
premises, noticed how much taller my cousin&#8217;s fir-tree
was than the one I called mine (we had planted
them one day, as little boys, years before), and
after I had had a drink at the old pump, which in
those days, before germs, brought up such cold,
clear water, and after I had ascended to my cool
room upstairs, and come downstairs again, and
we had idly talked for a little while, as I said, he
sat and looked at me a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you understand this tariff question?&#8221;</p>

<p>In those days I might have made the due, what I
might term with reference to that situation, the
conventional reply, and so have said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>In these days I am sure I should. But I hesitated.
He had already stretched forth his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He drew in his hand, and for an instant touched
with his long fingers the end of his large nose. I
plunged ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in favor of Free Trade, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not extend his hand. He looked at me
a moment, and then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right; we must support Mr. Cleveland
in the coming contest.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he sank back in his chair and laughed.</p>

<p>He was always like that, following the truth as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
he saw it, wherever it led him. But his active days
were not many after that; ere long he was kicked by
one of his horses, a vicious animal, half bronco,
which he insisted on riding, and he was invalided for
the rest of his days. He spent them in a wheel-chair,
pushed about by a negro boy. It was a cross
he bore bravely enough, without complaint, spending
his hours in reading of politics, now that he could
no longer participate in them, and more and more
in reading verse, and even in committing it to memory,
so that to the surprise of his family he soon
replaced the grace he had always said at table with
some recited stanza of poetry, and he took to cultivating,
or to sitting in his chair while there was
cultivated, under his direction, a little rose garden.
He knew all those roses as though they were living
persons: when a lady called,&mdash;if the roses were in
bloom,&mdash;he would say to his colored house-boy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go cut off Madame Maintenon, and bring her
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he would present Madame Maintenon to
the caller with such a bow as he could make in his
chair, and an apology for not rising. He was patient
and brave, yet he did not like to feel the
scepter passing from him, and he resented what he
considered interferences with his liberties. One day
when he had returned from a visit to an old friend,
to whose home his colored boy had wheeled him,
one of his daughters asked, in a somewhat exaggerated
tone of propitiation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Father, how did you find Mr. Hovey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found him master of his own house!&#8221; he blazed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>In 1896 he supported Mr. Bryan, and his Republican
neighbors said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Major Brand! His mind must be affected!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an effort for him to get out to the polls,
but he went, beholding in that conflict, as he could
in any conflict however confused and clouded, the
issue of free men above any other issue. He did
not get out much after that, even when that last
summer the few remnants of the 66th regiment gathered
in Urbana to hold the annual reunion. He
could not so much as get up town to greet his old
comrades, and they sent word that in the afternoon
they would march in review before his home. He
was wheeled out on the veranda, and there he sat
while his old regiment, the fifty or sixty gray,
broken men, marched past. They saluted as they
went by, and he returned the salutes with tears
streaming down the cheeks where I had never seen
tears before. And he said with a little choking
laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look at the boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long after, that six of us, his grandsons,
bore him out of the old home forever. And
on his coffin were the two things that expressed him
best, I think&mdash;his roses and his flag.</p>

<p>The incalculable influence of the spoken word and
the consequent responsibility that weighs upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
lightest phrase have so long been urged that men
might well go about with their fingers on their lips,
oracular as presidential candidates, deliberating
each thought before giving it wing. And yet, as
Carlyle said of French speech, the immeasurable
tide flows on and ebbs only toward the small hours
of the morning. Though even then in certain quarters,
the tide does not ebb, and in those hours truths
are sometimes spoken&mdash;for instance, by newspaper
reporters, who, their night&#8217;s work done, turn to each
other for relaxation and speak those thoughts they
have not dared to write in their chronicles of the
day that is done. The thought itself is only a
vagrant, encountered along the way back to such
an evening, when a reporter uttered two little words
that acquired for me a profound significance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing.&#8221; Those were the exact words, just
those two, and yet a negative so simple contained
within itself such an affirmation of an awful truth,
that I have never been able to forget them, though
for a time I tried. Charlie R&mdash;&mdash; and I had
gone one night, after the paper had gone to press,
into a little restaurant in Chicago to get some supper.
It was sometime in the year 1891, and, in
our idle gossip, the hanging of the anarchists, then
an event so recent that the reporters now and then
spoke of it, had come up in our talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you when that occurred?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Toledo,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did people think of it there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the hanging?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>I looked at him, I suppose, in some astonishment.
What did people in Toledo think of the hanging
of the Chicago anarchists! Could any question have
been more stupid, more banal? What did any
people, anywhere, think of it? What was customary,
what was proper and appropriate and indispensable
under such circumstances? In a word,
what was there to do with anarchists except to
hang them? Really, I was quite at a loss what to
say. It seemed so superfluous, so ridiculous, as
though he had asked what the people in Toledo
thought of the world&#8217;s being round, or of the force
of gravity. More than superfluous, it was callous;
he might as well have asked what Toledo people
thought of the hanging of Haman, the son of Hammedatha
the Agagite, or of the suicide of Judas Iscariot.
And I answered promptly in their defense:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they thought it was right, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had his elbows on the table and was lighting
a cigarette, and as he raised the match, his dark
face, with its closely trimmed pointed beard, was
suddenly and vividly illuminated by the yellow flame.
His eyes were lowered, their vision fixed just then
on the interesting process of igniting the end of
the cigarette. But about his puckered lips, about
his narrowed eyes there played a little smile, faint,
elusive, and yet of a meaning so indubitable that it
was altogether disconcerting. And in that instant
I wondered&mdash;it could not be! It was preposterous,
absurd!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>The end of the cigarette was glowing, little coils
of fire in the tiny particles of tobacco; he blew out
the match and the smile disappeared from his face
with its ruddy illumination, and he tossed the
charred stick into his coffee cup.</p>

<p>Were there, then, two opinions? Was it possible
that anyone doubted? When <i>anarchists</i> were
in question! Still, on that kindly face before me
there lingered the shadow of that strange expression,
inscrutable, perplexing, piquing curiosity.
And yet by some strange, almost clairvoyant process,
it had gradually acquired the effect of a persistent,
irresistible and implacable authority, in the
presence of which one felt&mdash;well, cheap, as though
there were secrets from which one had been excluded,
as though there were somewhere in this universe
a stupendous joke which alone of all others
one lacked the wit to see. It gave one a disturbed,
uneasy sensation, a <i>mauvaise honte</i>.</p>

<p>The innate sense of personal dignity, the instinct
to retire into one&#8217;s self, the affectation of repose
and self-sufficiency which leads one lightly to wave
aside a subject one does not understand, to pass it
over for other and more familiar topics&mdash;these were
ineffectual. Curiosity perhaps in a sense much less
refined than that in which Matthew Arnold considered
it when he exalted it to the plane of the higher
virtues, broke down reticence, and, at last I asked,
and even begged my companion to tell me what he
meant. But he was implacable; he had reached, it
appeared, a stage of development in which the
opinions of others were of no consequence; an altitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
from which he could regard the race of men
impersonally, and permit them to stumble on in
error, without the desire to set them right. It was
quite useless to question him, and in the end the
only satisfaction he would give me was to say, with
an effort of dismissing the subject:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask some of the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a young citizen to whom society is yet an
illusion, lying, in Emerson&#8217;s figure, before him in
rigid repose, with certain names, men and institutions
rooted like oak-trees to the center, round
which all arrange themselves the best they can, to
have one of those oak-trees torn violently up by
the roots, is to experience a distinct shock. And
by two words, and an expression that played for
an instant in lowered eyes, and about lips that were
more concerned just then with the flattened end of
a fresh cigarette than the divulgence of great
truths! Yes, decidedly a shock, to leave one shaken
for days. If there were any doubt as to what to
do with anarchists, what was the use of going on
with the study of the law? I went out from that
cheap little restaurant in Fifth Avenue, into Chicago&#8217;s
depressing midnight streets&mdash;and the oak tree
never took root again. For, as Charlie R&mdash;&mdash;
had lightly suggested, I asked the boys, and by the
boys he meant, of course, the reporters.</p>

<p>They were boys in spirit, though in the knowledge
of this world they were as aged men, some of whom
had seen so much of life that they were able to dwell
with it only by refusing any longer to accept it seriously.
They formed in that day an unusual group,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
gathered in the old Whitechapel Club, and many of
their names have since become known to literature.
They, or most of them, had worked on the anarchist
cases, from the days of the strike in McCormick&#8217;s
reaper works, down to the night when the
vivid pen of Charlie Seymour could describe the
spark that soared in a parabolic curve from the alley
into Haymarket Square, and then to the black
morning of the hanging; and they knew.</p>

<p>It was all very simple, too. If it were not for
the tragedy, and the wrong that is so much worse
than any tragedy, one might almost laugh at the
simplicity. It shows the power of words, the force
of phrases, the obdurate and terrible tyranny of
a term. The men who had been hanged were called
anarchists, when, as it happens, they were men, just
men. And out of that original error in terminology
there was evolved that overmastering fear which
raved and slew in a frenzy of passion that decades
hence will puzzle the psychologist who studies the
mind of the crowd. And the student of ethics will
find in the event another proof of the inerrancy
and power of that old law of moral action and reaction,
according to which hatred ceaseth not by
hatred, but by love alone. It may be found stated
accurately and simply in the Sermon on the Mount,
and there is still hope that Christendom, after another
thousand years or so, may discover it, and
drawing therefrom the law of social relations, apply
it to human affairs, and so solve the problems that
trouble and perplex mankind.</p>

<p>In speaking of the group of newspaper writers
who formed the Whitechapel Club, augmented as
they were by artists, and musicians and physicians
and lawyers, I would not give the impression that
they were in any sense reformers, or actuated by
the smug and forbidding spirit which too often inspires
that species. They were, indeed, wisely otherwise,
and they were, I think, wholly right minded
in their attitude toward what are called public questions,
and of these they had a deep and perspicacious
understanding, and it will be easy to imagine that
the cursory comments on passing phases of the human
spectacle of such minds as those of Charles
Goodyear Seymour, Finley Peter Dunne, George
Ade, Ben King, Opie Reed, Alfred Henry Lewis, and
his brother William E. Lewis, Frederick Upham Adams,
Thomas E. Powers, Horace Taylor, Wallace
Rice, Arthur Henry, and a score of others were
apt to be entertaining and instructive, though they
were uttered with such wit and humor that they
were never intended to be instructive.</p>

<p>The club had been founded late in the eighties,
and although it endured less than ten years, it still
lives in the minds of newspaper and literary men
as one of the most remarkable of Bohemian clubs.
It had its rooms in the rear of a little saloon, conducted
by Henry Koster in &#8220;newspaper alley,&#8221; as
Calhoun Place was more generally called, near the
buildings of the <i>Chicago News</i> and the <i>Chicago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Herald</i>, and it somehow gathered to itself many of
the clever men of Chicago who were writing for
the press, and a few intimate spirits in other lines
of work, but of sympathetic spirit. For a while the
club was nameless, but one afternoon a group were
sitting in one of the rooms when a newsboy passed
through the alley and cried: &#8220;All about the latest
Whitechapel murder!&#8221; Seymour paused with a
stein of beer half lifted, and said: &#8220;We&#8217;ll call the
new club the &#8216;Whitechapel Club.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I suppose the grewsome connotations of the name
led to our practice of collecting relics of the tragedies
we were constantly reporting. When he came
back from the Dakotas, where he had been reporting
the Sioux War, Seymour brought back from the
battles a number of skulls of Indians, and blankets
drenched in blood, which were hung on the walls
of the club. From that time on it became the practice
of sheriffs and newspaper men everywhere to
send anything of that kind to the Whitechapel Club.
The result was that within a few years it had a
large collection of skulls of criminals, and some
physicians discovered, or thought they discovered,
differences between these skulls and the skulls of
those who were not criminals, or, if they were, had
not been caught at it.</p>

<p>These and the ropes of hangmen and the various
mementos of crimes were the decorations of the club
rooms, and on Saturday nights the hollow eyes of
those skulls looked down on many a lively scene.</p>

<p>Admission to the club was obtained in a peculiar
way. An applicant for membership had his name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
proposed, and it was then posted on a bulletin-board.
He was on probation for thirty days, during
which he had to be at the club at least five days
in the week, in order to become acquainted with the
members. Within that time any member could tear
his name down, and that ended his candidacy.
When his name finally came up for voting it required
the full vote of the club to get him in.</p>

<p>And then we grew prosperous, and acquiring a
building farther down the alley, we had it decorated
in a somber manner, with a notable table, shaped like
a coffin, around which we gathered. But the prosperity
and the fame of the club led to its end. Rich
and important men of Chicago sought membership.
Some were admitted, then more, and as a result the
club lost its Bohemian character, and finally disbanded.</p>

<p>Those who are able to recall the symposium of
these minds will no doubt always see the humorous
face of Charlie Seymour as the center of the coterie,
a young man with such a <i>flair</i> for what was news,
with such an instinct for word values, such real
ability as a writer, and such a quaint and original
strain of humor as to make him the peer of any,
a young man who would have gone far and high
could he have lived. An early fate overtook him,
as it overtook Charlie Perkins and Charlie Almy
and Ben King, but their fate had the mellowing kindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
of the fact that all who knew them can never
think of them, with however much regret, without
a smile at some remembered instance of their unfailing
humor.</p>

<p>When I mentioned them, I had fully intended to
give some instances of that humor, but when it was
not of a raciness, it was of such a rare and delicate
charm, such a fleeting, evanescent quality, that it is
impossible to separate it from all that was going on
about it. It is easy enough to recall if not to evoke
again the scene in which Ben King and Charlie Almy,
sitting for three hours at a stretch, gave a wholly
impromptu impersonation of two solemn missionaries
just returned from some unmapped wilderness
and recounting their deeds in order to inspire contributions;
it is not difficult either to recall the
slight figure of Charlie Seymour, with his red hair,
his comedian&#8217;s droll face, and to listen to him recounting
those adventures which life was ever offering
him, whether on one of his many journeys as
a war correspondent to the region of the Dakotas
when his friends among the Ogallalla and Br&ucirc;l&eacute;
Sioux were on the war-path again, or in some less
picturesque tragedy he had been reporting nearer
home&mdash;say a murder in South Clark Street; but,
like so many of the keener joys of life, the charm
of his stories was fleeting and gone with the moment
that gave them.</p>

<p>His humor colored everything he wrote, as the
humor of Finley Peter Dunne colored everything he
wrote; and both were skilled in the art of the news
story. We were all reading Kipling in those days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
and Mr. Dunne was so clever in adapting his terse
style to the needs of the daily reportorial life that
when one night a private shot a comrade in the
barracks at Fort Sheridan, and Mr. Dunne was detailed
to report the tragedy, he found it in every
detail so exactly like Kipling&#8217;s story &#8220;In the Matter
of a Private,&#8221; that he was overcome by the
despair of having to write a tale that had already
been told. He resisted the temptation, if there was
any temptation, nobly and wrote the tale with a
bald simplicity that no doubt enhanced its effect.
He had not then begun to report the Philosophy of
Mr. Dooley, though there was a certain Irishman
in Chicago responsive to the name of Colonel
Thomas Jefferson Dolan, whom, in his capacity of
First Ward Democrat, Mr. Dunne frequently interviewed
for his paper without the cramping influences
of a previous visitation on the Colonel, and these
interviews showed much of the color and spirit of
those Dooley articles which later were to make him
famous. He already knew, of course, and frequently
enjoyed communion with the prototype of
Mr. Dooley, Mr. James McGarry, who had a quaint
philosophy of his own which Mr. Dunne one day
rendered in a little article entitled &#8220;Mr. McGarry&#8217;s
Philosophy.&#8221; The familiarity so wounded Mr.
McGarry, however (he was a man of simple dignity
and some sensitiveness), that Mr. Dunne thereafter
adopted another name for the personage
through which he was so long and so brilliantly to
express himself, though it was not until after the
Spanish War that the wide public was to recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the talent which was already so abundantly recognized
by Mr. Dunne&#8217;s friends.</p>

<p>Charlie Seymour did not read as much as some
of his companions; perhaps it was that fact that
gave such an original flavor to what he wrote. His
elder brother, Mr. Horatio W. Seymour, was the
editor of the <i>Herald</i>, a newspaper famed for the
taste and even beauty of its typographical appearance.
It looked somewhat like the New York <i>Sun</i>,
and under Mr. Seymour was as carefully edited.
It was the organ of the Democracy in the northwest,
and I suppose no direct or immediate influence was
more potent in bringing on the wide Democratic
victory in the congressional election of 1890 than the
brilliant editorials on the tariff which Mr. Horatio
Seymour wrote. They were, I remember, one of the
delights of Frank Hurd, and it was through Hurd&#8217;s
influence that I was on the staff of that paper, reporting
political events.</p>

<p>We were all more or less employed in reporting
political events in that stirring year, and were kept
busy in following and recording the sayings of the
orators of both parties. It was characteristic of
Mr. Dunne that after a sober column giving the gist
of a speech by Joseph B. Foraker, then lately governor,
and afterward senator of Ohio, in which he
waved the bloody shirt in the fiery manner which in
those days characterized him, Mr. Dunne should
have concluded his article sententiously: &#8220;Then the
audience went out to get the latest news of the battle
of Gettysburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was typical of Charlie Seymour that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
he was detailed to accompany Thomas B. Reed,
Speaker of the Billion Dollar Congress, he should
have been so fascinated by the whiskers of the Illinois
farmers who crowded about the rear platform
of the Speaker&#8217;s train, that he devoted half a column
to a description of those adornments which long
was celebrated as a classic in the traditions of Chicago
reporters, to be recalled by them as they
would recall, for instance, certain of the sayings of
the late Joseph Medill.</p>

<p>Mr. Medill, of course, moved in an element far
above that which was natural to the reporters, and
the figure of the great editor of the <i>Tribune</i> filled
the imagination completely. I used to like his low-tariff
editorials, though they became high-tariff editorials
during national campaigns, the rate of percentage
of protection rising like a thermometer in
the heat of political excitement,&mdash;a tendency the
rate invariably reveals the nearer its objective is
approached.</p>

<p>Mr. Medill, as was well known, was not an admirer
of President Harrison, and there came down
into our world an evidence of the fact in a story
which Mr. Frank Brooks, a political writer on the
<i>Tribune</i>, told us. It was at the time that President
Harrison made one of those speaking tours which,
beginning with President Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;swing around
the circle,&#8221; have grown increasingly familiar to those
of the electorate who observe their presidents and
rush to the railway station to hear them speaking
as they flash by. His managing editor had assigned
Mr. Brooks to go to Galesburg, catch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
President&#8217;s special and make the journey with him,
and just as he was giving directions as to the column
or two which Mr. Brooks was to send in daily, Mr.
Medill went shuffling through the editorial room,
bearing a great pile of those foreign exchanges he
was so fond of reading. The managing editor explained
to Mr. Medill the mission he was committing
to Mr. Brooks, and the old editor stood a moment
looking at them, then raised his ear-trumpet and
said in his queer voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said, I&#8217;d just been telling Mr. Brooks to go
down to Galesburg to-night, catch the President&#8217;s
special, and send us a column or so each night of
his speeches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh,&#8221; said Mr. Medill, and then he drily
added: &#8220;<i>What for?</i>&#8221;</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2>
</div>


<p>It was, of course, for a young correspondent who
hod an eager curiosity about life, an interesting
experience to go on a journey like that, and it was
with delight that, one snowy morning in the late
autumn of that year, I left Chicago to go on a little
trip down through Indiana with James G. Blaine.
He was the secretary of state in President Harrison&#8217;s
cabinet, a position in which, as it turned out,
he was unhappy, as most men are apt to be in public
positions, though a sort of cruel and evil fascination
will not let them give up the vain pursuit of
them, vainest perhaps when they are won. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
I reached the station that morning, Mr. Blaine was
already there, walking up and down the platform
arm in arm with his son Emmons. He was a gray
man, dressed in gray clothes, with spats made of the
cloth of his habit, and there was about him an air
of vague sadness, which in his high countenance became
almost a pain, though just then, in the companionship
of the son he loved, there was, for a
little while, the expression of a mild happiness, maybe
a solace. His face was of a grayish, almost luminous
pallor, and his silver hair and beard were in
the same key. William Walter Phelps, then our
minister to Germany, was traveling with him, and
on our way down to South Bend the constant entrance
of plain citizens from the other coaches into
our car filled Mr. Phelps with a kind of wonder.
Commercial travelers, farmers, all sorts and conditions
of men, entered and introduced themselves to
Mr. Blaine, and he sat and talked with them all in
that simplicity which marks the manners, even if it
has departed the spirit of the republic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a remarkable sight you are witnessing,&#8221; said
Mr. Phelps to us reporters, &#8220;a sight you could witness
in no other country in the world. There is the
premier of a great government, and yet the commonest
man may approach him without ceremony,
and talk to him as though he were nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fresh from his life at a foreign court, he was
viewing events from that foreign point of view, perhaps
thinking just then in European sequences, and
since there was such simplicity, it was not hard for
any of us to have conversation with our premier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Mr. Blaine had just come from Ohio where he had
been speaking in McKinley&#8217;s district, and he understood
the political situation so perfectly that he said,
in the frankness of a conversation that was not to be
reported, that McKinley was certain to be defeated;
indeed he foresaw, though it required no very great
vision to do that, the reverse that was to overtake
his party in the congressional elections.</p>

<p>With my interest in the tariff question, which then
seemed to me so fundamental, I did not lose the
opportunity to ask Mr. Blaine about his reciprocity
project: but after a while the conversation turned
to more personal subjects. When he learned that I
was from Ohio, he asked me suddenly if I could name
the counties that formed the several congressional
districts of the state. I could not, of course, do
that, and I supposed no one in the world could do
it or ever wish to do it; but he could, and with a
na&iuml;ve pride in the accomplishment he did, and then
astounded me by saying that he could almost match
the feat with any state in the Union.</p>

<p>It was the only enthusiasm the poor man showed
all that day, and when we reached South Bend, there
was a <i>contretemps</i> that might have afforded Mr.
Phelps further food for reflection on the lack of ceremony
in America. When the premier stepped off
the train into the wet mass of snow that covered the
dirty platform of the ugly little station, there was
nowhere to be seen any evidence of a reception for
the distinguished guest. There was an old hack, or
&#8217;bus, one of those rattling, shambling, moth-eaten
vehicles that await the incoming train at every small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
town in our land, with a team of forlorn horses depressed
by the weather or by life, but there was no
committee of eminent citizens, no band, nothing.
The scene was bare and bleak and cold, and the
premier was plainly disgusted.</p>

<p>He stood there a moment and looked about him
undecided, while Mr. Phelps with sympathetic concern
displayed great willingness to serve, but was as
helpless as his chief. The American sovereigns who
were loafing by the station shed looked on with the
reticent detachment which characterizes the rural
American. And then the train slowly pulled out and
left us, and Mr. Blaine cast at it a glance of longing
and of reproach, as though in its sundering of the
last tie with the world of comfort, he had suffered
the final indignity. There seemed to be no course
other than to take the &#8217;bus, when suddenly a committee
rushed up, out of breath and out of countenance,
and with a chorus of apologies explained
that they had met the wrong train, or gone to another
station, and so bore the premier off in triumph
to dine at some rich man&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>The day seemed to grow worse as it progressed, as
days ill begun have a way of doing, and when the
premier in the afternoon appeared at the meeting
he was to address, his spirits had not improved, and
even if they had, the meeting was one to depress the
spirits of any man. It assembled in a barren hall,
a kind of skating rink, or something of the sort, that
would have served better for a boxing match. The
audience was small, and standing about in the mud
and slush they had &#8220;tramped in,&#8221; to use our midwestern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
phrase, they displayed that bucolic indifference
which can daunt the most exuberant speaker.
It was in no way worthy of the man, and Mr. Blaine
spoke with evident difficulty, and so wholly lacked
spirit and enthusiasm that it was impossible for
him to warm up to his subject. The speech was of
that perfunctory sort which such an atmosphere
compels, one of those speeches the speaker drags
out, a word at a time, and is glad to be done with,
and Mr. Blaine bore with his fates a little while, and
then almost abruptly closed. He spoke on the tariff
issue, and in defense of the McKinley Bill, and in
marshaling the evidences of our glory and prosperity,
all of which he attributed to the direct influence
of the protective tariff system, he mentioned
the number of miles of railroad that had been built,
and even the increase in the nation&#8217;s population!
The speech and the occasion afforded an opportunity
to a newspaper of the opposition, which in
those days of silly partizanship, was not to be overlooked.
I went back to the little hotel and wrote
my story, and since I had all the while in my mind
not only partizan advantage, but the smiles that
would break out on the countenances of Charlie
Seymour and Peter Dunne and the other boys gathered
in the Whitechapel Club I did not minimise
the effect of all those babies who had come to life
as a result of the protective tariff, nor all those
ironical difficulties the day had heaped upon the
great man. It was not, perhaps, quite fair, nor quite
nice, but it was as fair and as nice as newspaper ethics
and political etiquette&mdash;if there are such things&mdash;require,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and Mr. Blaine himself most have had
some consciousness of his partial failure, some dissatisfaction
with his effort, for I was just about
to put my story on the wire at six o&#8217;clock when he
appeared, with his rich host, and asked for me. I
talked to him through the little wicket of the telegraph
office, and the conversation began inauspiciously
by the rich man&#8217;s peremptorily commanding
me to let him see my stuff; he wished, he said, to
&#8220;look it over&#8221;! I was not as patient with his presumption
then as I think I could be now, for I had
not learned that it was the factory system that produces
such types, men who bully the women at home
and the women and clerks and operatives in their
shops, and I denied him the right, of course. He
became very angry, and blustered through the little
window, while the operator, an old telegrapher I had
known in Toledo, sat behind me waiting to send the
story clicking into Chicago on <i>The Herald&#8217;s</i> wire.
After the rich man had exhausted himself, Mr.
Blaine took his place at the window and in a mild
and calm manner, asked me for my copy, saying
that he was not well, and that he had made some
slips in his speech which he did not care to have go
to the country. It was those unfortunate or fortunate
babies of the protective tariff system, and he
said that the correspondent of a press association
had agreed to make the excisions if I would do so,
and he would consider it a favor if I would oblige
him.</p>

<p>The charm of his manner had been on me all that
day, and I had been feeling sorry for him all day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
too, and I was sorrier for him then than ever, and
half ashamed of some of the things I had written, but
I explained to him that I had been sent by my paper
in the hope that he might say something to the disadvantage
of his own cause, and that my duty was
to report, at least, what he had said. It was one of
the hardest &#8220;noes&#8221; I ever had to say, and at last as
he turned away, I regretted, perhaps more than
he, and certainly more than he ever knew, that I
could not let him revise his speech&mdash;since that is
what most of us desire to do with most of our
speeches.</p>

<p>When that campaign ended in the overthrow of
the Republican majority in Congress, and I was sent
to interview Ben Butterworth on the result, he said,
in his humorous way: &#8220;The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the
Lord.&#8221; He was not altogether cast down by the result;
in his place in Congress as a representative
from a Cincinnati district he had risen to denounce
the tariff, and so had his consolation. To me it
seemed as if the people had at last entered the promised
land, that that was the day the Lord had made
for his people, but Mr. Butterworth could point out
that our government was not so democratic as the
British government, for instance, since it was not so
responsive to the people&#8217;s will. Over there, of
course, after such a reverse the government would
have retired, and a new one would have been formed,
but here the existing administration would remain in
power two years longer, and then, even if it lost in
the presidential election over a year must elapse before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
a new Congress would convene, so that the millennium
was postponed a good three years at least.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>
</div>


<p>However, there were other interests and other delights
with which to occupy one&#8217;s self meanwhile, not
the least of which was Mr. Butterworth himself.
He was then out of Congress and in Chicago as Solicitor
General of the World&#8217;s Columbian Exposition,
for which Chicago was preparing. For a while
I was relieved from writing about politics, and assigned
to the World&#8217;s Fair, and there were so many
distinguished men from all over the nation associated
in that enterprise that it was very much like politics
in its superficial aspects. There was, for instance,
the World&#8217;s Columbian Commission, a body created
under the authority of Congress, composed of two
commissioners from each state, appointed by its
governor, and that body exactly the size of the
senate was like it in personnel and character. The
witty Thomas E. Palmer of Michigan was its president,
and there were among its membership such
men as Judge Lindsay, later senator from Kentucky,
Judge Harris of Virginia, who looked like George
Washington, and many other delightful and pungent
characters. But no personality among them all was
more interesting than Colonel James A. McKenzie,
Judge Lindsay&#8217;s colleague from Kentucky. He was
tall and spare of frame, and his long moustache
and goatee, and the great black slouch hat he wore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
made him in appearance the typical southerner of
the popular imagination. He was indeed the typical
southerner by every right and tradition, by birth,
by his services in the Confederate army, by his
stately courtesy, by his love of sentiment and the
picturesque, by his wit and humor and eloquence,
and his fondness for phrases. His humor sparkled in
his kind blue eyes, and it overflowed in that brilliant
conversation with which he delighted everyone
about him; he could entertain you by the hour with
his comments on all phases of that life in which he
found such zest. He had been known as &#8220;Quinine
Jim,&#8221; because as congressman he had secured the
reduction or the abolition of the duty on that drug,
so indispensable in malarial lands. He was fond of
striking phrases; he it was who had referred to
Blaine as a Florentine mosaic; and his reference to
Mrs. Cleveland as &#8220;the uncrowned queen of America&#8221;
had delighted the Democratic convention at St.
Louis which renominated her husband for the presidency.
And again at Chicago, on that memorable
night of oratory in 1892 in seconding the nomination
of Cleveland on behalf of Kentucky he stood on a
chair and referred to his state as the commonwealth
&#8220;in which, thank God, the damned lie is the first
lick, where the women are so beautiful that the
aurora borealis blushes with shame, where the
whiskey is so good as to make intoxication a virtue,
and the horses so fleet that lightning in comparison
is but a puling paralytic.&#8221;</p>

<p>During one of many pleasant afternoons in the
old Grand Pacific Hotel he began to tell us something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
about the chronic office holders to be found in
the capital of his state, as in most states, and said:
&#8220;If God in a moment of enthusiasm should see fit
to snatch them to His bosom I should regard it as a
dispensation of divine providence in which I could
acquiesce with a fervor that would be turbulent and
even riotous.&#8221; It was in this stream of exaggeration
and hyperbole that he talked all the time, but with
the coming of the winter of that year my opportunities
of listening to him were cut off. I was sent to
Springfield to report the sessions of the legislature.
In the spring a bill was under discussion for the
appropriation of a large sum in aid of the World&#8217;s
Fair, and when the usual opposition developed
among those country members who have so long
governed our cities in dislike and distrust of the
people in them, a delegation came down from Chicago
to lobby for the measure. It was not long
until it was evident that they were not making
much headway; the difference, the distinction in
their dress and manner, their somewhat too lofty
style were only making matters worse. I took it
upon myself to telegraph to James W. Scott, the
publisher of <i>The Herald</i>, apprising him of the situation,
and suggesting that Colonel McKenzie be sent
down to re&euml;nforce them. I felt that he would perhaps
understand the country members better because
he understood humanity better, and besides, I
wished to see him again and hear his stories and
funny sayings. He came, and after he had associated
with the members a day or so, and they had
seen him draw Kentucky &#8220;twist&#8221; from the deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
pocket of the long tails of his coat, and on one or
two occasions had watched him gently pinch into a
julep the tender sprigs of mint the spring had
brought to Springfield, the appropriation for some
reason was made. While he was there he said he
wished to visit the tomb of Lincoln, and it was with
pride that I got an open carriage and drove him, on
an incomparable morning in June, out to Oak Ridge
cemetery. He was in a solemn mood that morning;
the visit had a meaning for him; he had fought on
the other side in the great war, but he had a better
conception of the character of the noble martyr than
many a northerner, especially of the day when that
tomb was built, certainly a nobler conception of
that lofty character than is expressed in Mead&#8217;s
cruel war groups&mdash;as though Lincoln had been
merely some shoulder-strapped murderer of his fellow
men! The Colonel had never been there before,
and it was an occasion for him, and for me, too,
though every time I went there it was for me an occasion,
as my sojourn in Springfield was an opportunity,
to induce those who had known Lincoln to
talk about him.</p>

<p>The tomb has a chamber in its base where there
were stored a number of things; the place, indeed,
was a sort of cheap museum, and you paid to enter
there and listen to an aged custodian lecture on the
&#8220;relics,&#8221; and thrill the gaping onlooker with the
details of the attempt to steal the body, and buy a
book about it, if you were morbid and silly enough.
The custodian began his lecture in that chamber,
and then led you out into the sunlight again, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
up on the base of the monument, and showed you the
bronze fighters, and at last, took you down into the
crypt, on the brow of the little down that overlooks
the cemetery.</p>

<p>There at last Colonel McKenzie stood beside the
sarcophagus and after a while the custodian came
to the end of his rigmarole, and, by some mercy, was
still. And I stood aside and looked at the old Confederate
officer, standing there in that cool entrance,
beside the very tomb of Lincoln. He stood with
his arms folded on his breast, his tall form
slightly bent, his big hat in his hand, and his
white head bowed; he stood there a long time, in
the perfect silence of that June morning, with
thoughts, I suppose, that might have made an
epic.</p>

<p>When at last he turned away and went around to
the front of the monument, and we were about to
enter our carriage, he turned, and still uncovered,
over the little gate in the low fence that enclosed
the spot, he paused and gave his hand to the old
custodian, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel, I wish to express to you my appreciation
of the privilege I have had this morning of
paying my respects at the shrine of the greatest
American that ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said it solemnly and sincerely, and then, still
holding the delighted old fellow&#8217;s hand, he went on
in profound gravity:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I cannot go away without expressing my
sense of satisfaction in the eloquent oration you have
delivered on this occasion. I was particularly impressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
sir, by its evident lack of previous thought
and preparation.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the legislature which elected John M.
Palmer to the United States Senate from Illinois.
The election was accomplished only after a memorable
deadlock of two months in which the Democrats
of the general assembly stood so nobly, shoulder to
shoulder, that they were called &#8220;The Immortal 101.&#8221;
When they were finally re&euml;nforced by the votes of
two members elected as representatives of the Farmers&#8217;
Alliance, and elected their man, they had a gold
medal struck to commemorate their own heroism.
They were not, perhaps, exactly immortal, but they
did stand for their principles so stanchly that when
they came to celebrate their victory, some of their
orators compared them to those other immortals who
held Thermopyl&aelig;.</p>

<p>Their principle was the popular election of United
States senators, and they had a fine exemplar of
democracy in their candidate. He had been nominated
by a state convention, as had Lincoln, whom
General Palmer had known intimately and had supported
both for senator and president. He was the
last of those great figures of Illinois whom the times
immediately preceding the Civil War had so abundantly
brought forth. He had commanded an army
corps, he had been governor of his state, and in
1872 a presidential possibility in the Republican
party. But he had turned to the Democrats, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
after he became their senator, the first Illinois had
known since Douglas, he became a presidential possibility
in the Democratic party; that was in 1892,
and whatever chances he had he destroyed himself
by coming on from Washington and declaring for
Grover Cleveland.</p>

<p>Four years later he was nominated for the presidency
by the conservative faction of his party. He
told me, when I was finishing my law studies under
him, that he had never lost anything politically by
bolting any of the several parties he had been in, but
had usually gained in self respect by doing so; and
if to the politician his whole career presented inconsistencies,
to the man of principle he must seem
wholly consistent and sincere. Certain it is that he
followed that inward spirit which alone can guide a
man through the perplexities of life, and so the principle
with him came ever before the party.</p>

<p>He was a simple man with simple tastes, and his
very simplicity was an element of that dignity which
seemed to belong to other times than ours. The
familiar figure of him along the quiet streets of
Springfield was pleasing to men and to children
alike; he would go along erectly and slowly under
his great broad hat, a striking figure with his plentiful
white hair, his closely trimmed chin whiskers,
the broad, smoothly shaven upper lip distinguishing a
countenance that was of a type associated with the
earlier ideals of the republic, and the market basket
he carried on his arm helped this effect. At home
he was delightful; he had a viol, and used to play it,
if there were not too many about to hear him, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
he were alone, sing a few staves of old songs, like
&#8220;Darling Nelly Gray,&#8221; and &#8220;Rosie Lee, Courting
Down in Tennessee,&#8221; and some of the old tunes he
had learned in Kentucky as a boy. He liked poetry,
if it were not of the introspective modern mood, and
while I have heard of such extraordinary characters,
I never believed the stories of their endurance, until
I was able to discover in him one man who actually
did read Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s novels through every
year. For the most part he had some member of his
family read them to him, and he found in them the
na&iuml;ve pleasure of a child. I used to think I would
remember the things he was always saying, and the
stories he was always telling about Lincoln or Douglas
or Grant, but I never could keep note-books and
the more imposing sayings have departed. Yet
there flashes before the memory with the detail of a
cinematograph that scene of a winter&#8217;s evening when
I entered the big living-room in his home and there
found him with his wife before the great open fire.
She was reading aloud to him from &#8220;Ivanhoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Mr. Brand,&#8221; he always addressed me
by prefixing &#8220;Mr.&#8221; to my Christian name. &#8220;Come
in,&#8221; he called in his hearty voice. &#8220;We are just
storming a castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lived on to the century&#8217;s end, with a sort of
gusto in life that never failed, I think, until that
day when he attended the funeral of the last of his
old contemporaries, General John M. McClernand,
that fierce old warrior who had quarreled with Grant
and lived on in Springfield until he could fight no
more with anyone. Senator Palmer came home from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
his funeral amused by the fact that McClernand had
been buried in the full uniform of a major-general,
which he had not worn, I suppose, since Vicksburg.
When some member of Senator Palmer&#8217;s household
asked him if he should like to be buried in his uniform,
he shook his head against it, but added:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all right for Mac; it was like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the end was in his thoughts; Oglesby was
gone, and now McClernand as the last of the men
with whom he had fought in the great crisis, and
he went, pretty soon after that, himself. He had
participated in two great revolutionary epochs of
his nation, going through the one and penetrating
though not so far into the second, a long span of
life and experience.</p>

<p>It was perhaps natural that he should not have
divined the implications of the second phase as
clearly as he did those of the first; and though he
had helped to inaugurate the new movement, the latest
urge toward democracy in this land, he could
not go so far. He was young in &#8217;56 and old in &#8217;96,
and as we grow old we grow conservative, whether
we would or not, and much, I suppose, in the same
way.</p>

</div>


<p>Senator Palmer&#8217;s victory in 1891, however, had
raised the hopes of the Illinois Democracy for 1892,
and it was early in that year that I came to know
one of the most daring pioneers of the neo-democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
movement in America, and the most courageous
spirit of our times.</p>

<p>It was on a cold raw morning that I met Joseph
P. Mahony, then a Democratic member of the State
Senate, who said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me and I&#8217;ll introduce you to the next
governor of Illinois.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the time of year when one was meeting
the next governor of Illinois in most of the hotel
corridors, or men who were trying to look like potential
governors of Illinois, so that such a remark
was not to be taken too literally; but I went, and
after ascending to an upper floor of a narrow little
building in Adams Street, we entered a suite of law
offices, and there in a very much crowded, a very
much littered and a rather dingy little private room,
at an odd little walnut desk, sat John P. Altgeld.</p>

<p>The figure was not prepossessing; he wore his
hair close-clipped in ultimate surrender to an obstinate
cowlick; his beard was closely trimmed, too, and
altogether the countenance was one made for the
hands of the cartoonists, who in the brutal fury that
was so soon to blaze upon him and to continue to
blaze until it had consumed him quite, could easily
contort the features to the various purposes of an
ugly partizanship; they gave it a peculiarly sinister
quality, and it is one of the countless ironies of life
that a face, sad with all the utter woe of humanity,
should have become for a season, and in some minds
remained forever, the type and symbol of all that is
most abhorrent. There was a peculiar pallor in the
countenance, and the face was such a blank mask of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
suffering and despair that, had it not been for
the high intelligence that shone from his eyes, it must
have impressed many as altogether lacking in expression.
Certainly it seldom or never expressed enthusiasm,
or joy, or humor, though he had humor of a
certain mordant kind, as many a political opponent
was to know.</p>

<p>He had been a judge of the Circuit Court, and
was known by his occasional addresses, his interviews
and articles, as a publicist of radical and
humanitarian tendencies. He was known especially
to the laboring classes and to the poor, who, by
that acute sympathy they possess, divined in him
a friend, and in the circles of sociological workers
and students, then so small and obscure as to make
their views esoteric, he was recognized as one who
understood and sympathized with their tendencies
and ideals. He was accounted in those days a
wealthy man,&mdash;he was just then building one of those
tall and ugly structures of steel called &#8220;sky-scrapers,&#8221;&mdash;and
now that he was spoken of for governor
this fact made him seem &#8220;available&#8221; to the politicians.
Also he had a German name, another asset in
Illinois just then, when Germans all over the state
felt themselves outraged by legislation concerning
the &#8220;little red school-house,&#8221; which the Republicans
had enacted when they were in full power in the
state.</p>

<p>But my paper did not share this enthusiasm about
him; it happened to be owned by John R. Walsh, and
between Walsh and Altgeld there was a feud, a feud
that cost Altgeld his fortune, and lasted until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
day that death found him poor and crushed by all
the tragedy which a closer observer, one with a
keener prescience of destiny than I, might have read
in his face from the first.</p>

<p>The feeling of the paper, if one may so personalize
a corporation as to endow it with emotion, was not
corrected by his nomination, and <i>The Herald</i> had
little to say of him, and what it did say was given out
in the perfunctory tone of a party organ. But as
the summer wore on, and I was able to report to my
editors that all the signs pointed to Altgeld&#8217;s election,
I was permitted to write an article in which I
tried to describe his personality and to give some
impression of the able campaign he was making.
Horace Taylor drew some pictures to illustrate it,
and I had the satisfaction of knowing that it gave
Altgeld pleasure, while at the same time to me at
least it revealed for an instant the humanness of the
man.</p>

<p>He sent for me&mdash;he was then in offices in his new
sky-scraper&mdash;and asked if I could procure for him
Horace Taylor&#8217;s pictures; he hesitated a moment,
and then, as though it were a weakness his Spartan
nature was reluctant to reveal, he told me that he
intended to have my article republished in a newspaper
in Mansfield, Ohio, the town whence he had
come, where he had taught school, and where he
had met the gracious lady who was his wife. He
talked for a while that afternoon about his youth,
about his poverty and his struggles, and then suddenly
lapsed into a silence, with his eyes fastened
on me. I wondered what he was looking at; his gaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
was disconcerting, and it made me self-conscious and
uneasy, till he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could one get a cravat like the one you
have on?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, I remember&mdash;because of the odd incident&mdash;an
English scarf of blue, quite new. I had tried to
knot it as Ben Cable of the Democratic National
Committee knotted his, and it seemed that such a
little thing should not be wanting to the happiness
of a man who, by all the outward standards, had so
much to gratify him as Altgeld had, and I said&mdash;with
some embarrassment, and some doubt as to the
taste I was exhibiting&mdash;&#8220;Why, you may have this
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment his face changed, the mask fell, and
he shook his head and said: &#8220;No, it would not look
like that on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>After his election it was suggested to me that I
might become his secretary, but I declined; in my
travels over the state as a political correspondent I
was always meeting aged men, seemingly quite respectable
and worthy and entirely well meaning, who
were introduced not so much by name as such
and such a former governor&#8217;s private secretary;
though like the moor which Browning crossed, they
had</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">... names of their own,</div>
<div class="verse">And a certain use in the world, no doubt.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But I did take a position in the office of the secretary
of state that offered the opportunity I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
been longing for; I wished to finish my law studies,
and, deeper down than any ambition for the bar, I
was nourishing a desire to write, or if it does not
seem too pretentious, an ambition in literature; and
neither of these aims could well be accomplished,
say from midnight on, after working all day on a
morning newspaper.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant change. Springfield was lovely
in the spring, which came to it earlier than it visited
Chicago, and it was a relief to escape the horrid
atmosphere of a great brutal city which as a reporter
it had seemed my fate to behold for the most
part at night. There was a sense of spaciousness in
the green avenues of the quiet town, and there was
pleasant society, and better perhaps than all there
were two big libraries in the Capitol, the law library
of the Supreme Court and the state library; and
after the noisy legislature had adjourned a peace
fell on the great, cool stone pile that was almost
academic.</p>

<p>Twice or thrice a day Governor Altgeld was to be
seen passing through its vast corridors, his head
bent thoughtfully, rapt afar from the things about
him in those dreams of social amelioration which had
visited him so much earlier than they came to most
of his contemporaries. He had read much, and
during his residence there the executive mansion
had the atmosphere of intellectual culture. Whenever
I went over there, which I did now and then with
his secretary for luncheon or for an evening at cards,
our talk was almost always of books.</p>

<p>We were all reading George Meredith in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
days, and Meredith&#8217;s greater contemporary, Thomas
Hardy. &#8220;Tess&#8221; had just appeared, and it would
be about that time that &#8220;Jude&#8221; was running as a
serial in <i>Harper&#8217;s Magazine</i>, though with many elisions
and under its tentative titles of &#8220;The Simpleton&#8221;
and &#8220;Hearts Insurgent&#8221;; and we all fell completely
under a fascination which has never failed of
its weird and mysterious charm, so that I have read
all his works, down to his latest poems, over and
over again. Hardy is, perhaps, the greatest intelligence
on our planet now that Tolstoy, from whom
he so vastly differed, is gone, and Altgeld&#8217;s whole
career might have served him, had he ever chosen to
write of those experiences that are less implicit in
human nature, and more explicit in the superficial
aspects of public careers, as an example of his own
pagan theory of the contrariety of human affairs
and the spite of the Ironic Spirits.</p>

<p>I was reading, too, the novels of Mr. William
Dean Howells, as I always have been whenever there
was a moment to spare, and it was with a shock of
peculiar delight and a sense of corroboration almost
authoritative that I learned that Mr. Howells also
had given voice to those very same profound and
troubling convictions which Charlie R&mdash;&mdash; had set
me on the track of two years before.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>


<p>It was not in any one of Mr. Howells&#8217;s novels or
essays, except inferentially, that I learned this, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
among some musty documents the worms were eating
up away down in the foundations of the State
House.</p>

<p>My work in the office of the secretary of state
involved the care of the state&#8217;s archives. The oldest
of these were stored in a vault in the cellar of the
huge pile, and the discovery had just been made
that some kind of insect, which the state entomologist
knew all about, was riddling those records with
little holes,&mdash;piercing them through and through.
In consequence a new vault was prepared, and steel
filing cases were set up in it, and the records removed
to this safer sanctuary.</p>

<p>It was a tedious and stupid task, until we came
one day to file what were called the papers in the
anarchist case. Officially they related to the application
for the commutation of the sentences of the
four men, Spies, Engel, Fischer, and Parsons, who
had been hanged, and for the pardon of the three
who were then confined in the penitentiary at Joliet,
Fielden and Schwab for life, and old Oscar Neebe
for fifteen years. Fielden and Schwab had been sentenced
to death with the four who had been killed,
but Governor Oglesby had commuted their sentences
to imprisonment for life; Neebe&#8217;s original sentence
had been for the fifteen years he was then serving.
The papers consisted of communications to the governor,
great petitions, and letters and telegrams,
many sent in mercy, and some in the spirit of reason,
asking for clemency, many in a wild hysteria of fear,
and the hideous hate that is born of fear, begging
the governor to let &#8220;justice&#8221; take its course.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>There were the names of many prominent men
and women signed to these communications; among
them was a request signed by many authors in England
requesting clemency, but there was no appeal
stronger, and no protest braver, than that in the
letter which Mr. Howells had written to a New
York newspaper analyzing the case and showing the
amazing injustice of the whole proceeding. Mr.
Howells had first gone, so he told me in after years,
to the aged poet Whittier, whose gentle philosophy
might have moved him to a mood against that public
wrong, and then to George William Curtis, but they
had advised him to write the protest himself, and he
had done so, and he had done it better and more
bravely than either of them could have done out of
the great conscience and the great heart that have
always been on the side of the weak and the oppressed,
with a mercy which when it is practised by
mankind is always so much nearer the right and the
divine than our crude and generally cruel attempts
at justice can ever be.</p>

<p>But all these prayers had fallen on official ears
that&mdash;to use a grotesque figure&mdash;were so closely
pressed to the ground that they could not hear; and
there was nothing to do, since they were so many
and so bulky that no latest-improved and patented
steel filing-case could hold them, but to have a big
box made and lock them up in that for all time, forgotten,
like so many other records of injustice, out
of the minds of men.</p>

<p>But not entirely; injustice was never for long out
of the mind of John P. Altgeld, and during all those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
first months of his administration he had been brooding
over this notable instance of injustice, and he
had come to his decision. He knew the cost to him;
he had just come to the governorship of his state,
and to the leadership of his party, after its thirty
years of defeat, and he realized what powerful interests
would be frightened and offended if he were
to turn three forgotten men out of prison; he understood
how partizanship would turn the action to its
advantage.</p>

<p>It mattered not that most of the thoughtful men
in Illinois would tell you that the &#8220;anarchists&#8221; had
been improperly convicted, that they were not only
entirely innocent of the murder of which they had
been accused, but were not even anarchists; it was
simply that the mob had convicted them in one of
the strangest frenzies of fear that ever distracted a
whole community, a case which all the psychologists
of all the universities in the world might have tried,
without getting at the truth of it&mdash;much less a jury
in a criminal court.</p>

<p>And so, one morning in June, very early, I was
called to the governor&#8217;s office, and told to make out
pardons for Fielden, Neebe, and Schwab. &#8220;And do
it yourself,&#8221; said the governor&#8217;s secretary, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t say anything about it to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>I cannot tell in what surprise, in what a haze, or
with what emotions I went about that task. I got
the blanks and the records, and, before the executive
clerk, whose work it was, had come down, I
made out those three pardons, in the largest, roundest
hand I could command, impressed them with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Great Seal of State, had the secretary of state sign
them, and took them over to the governor&#8217;s office.
I was admitted to his private room, and there he
sat, at his great flat desk. The only other person in
the room was Dreier, a Chicago banker, who had
never wearied, it seems, in his efforts to have
those men pardoned. He was standing, and was
very nervous; the moment evidently meant much to
him. The Governor took the big sheets of imitation
parchment, glanced over them, signed his name to
each, laid down the pen, and handed the papers
across the table to Dreier. The banker took them,
and began to say something. But he only got as
far as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Governor, I hardly&#8221;&mdash;when he broke down and
wept. Altgeld made an impatient gesture; he was
gazing out of the window in silence, on the elm-trees
in the yard. He took out his watch, told Dreier he
would miss his train&mdash;Dreier was to take the Alton
to Joliet, deliver the pardons to the men in person,
and go on into Chicago with them that night&mdash;and
Dreier nervously rolled up the pardons, took up a
little valise, shook hands, and was gone.</p>

<p>On the table was a high pile of proofs of the document
in which Governor Altgeld gave the reasons for
his action. It was an able paper; one might well
rank it among state papers, and I suppose no one
now, in these days, when so many of Altgeld&#8217;s democratic
theories are popular, would deny that his
grounds were just and reasonable, or that he had
done what he could to right a great wrong; though
he would regret that so great a soul should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
permitted itself to mar the document by expressions
of hatred of the judge who tried the case. But perhaps
it is not so easy to be calm and impersonal in
the midst of the moving event, as it is given to others
to be long afterward.</p>

<p>But whatever feelings he may have had, he was
calm and serene ever after. I saw him as I was
walking down to the Capitol the next morning. It
was another of those June days which now and then
are so perfect on the prairies. The Governor was
riding his horse&mdash;he was a gallant horseman&mdash;and
he bowed and smiled that faint, wan smile of his, and
drew up to the curb a moment. There was, of
course, but one subject then, and I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the storm will break now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he replied, with a not wholly convincing
air of throwing off a care, &#8220;I was prepared
for that. It was merely doing right.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said something to him then to express my satisfaction
in the great deed that was to be so wilfully,
recklessly, and cruelly misunderstood. I did not say
all I might have said, for I felt that my opinions
could mean so little to him. I have wished since that
I had said more,&mdash;said something, if that might have
been my good fortune, that could perhaps have
made a great burden a little easier for that brave
and tortured soul. But he rode away with that wan,
persistent smile. And the storm did break, and the
abuse it rained upon him broke his heart; but I
never again heard him mention the anarchist case.</p>

<p>The newspapers were so extravagant in their
abuse of Governor Altgeld for his pardon of the
anarchists that one not knowing the facts might have
received the impression that the Governor had already
pardoned most of the prisoners in the penitentiary,
and would presently pardon those that
remained, provided the crimes they had committed,
or were said to have committed, had been
heinous enough. The fact was that he issued no
more pardons, proportionately at least, than the
governors who preceded him, since notwithstanding
the incessant grinding of society&#8217;s machinery
of vengeance the populations of prisons grow
with the populations outside of them.</p>

<p>But partizanship was intense in those days; and
the fact that Governor Altgeld was responsible for
such a hegira from the Capitol at Springfield as
Colonel McKenzie had longed to behold in the Capitol
at Frankfort exacerbated the bitter feeling. The
sentiment thus created, however, did increase the
hopes of convicts, and the Governor was continually
importuned by their friends&mdash;those of them that had
friends, which was apt to be a pitifully small percentage
of the whole number&mdash;to give them back
their liberty. A few weeks after the pardons had
been issued to the anarchists, George Brennan of
Braidwood, then a clerk in the State House, told me
a moving story of a young man of his acquaintance,
who was then confined in the penitentiary at Joliet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
The young man was dying of tuberculosis, and his
mother, having no other hope than that he might be
released to die at home, had made her appeal to
Brennan, and he had seen to the filing of an application
in due form, and now he asked me if I would not
call the Governor&#8217;s attention to it. I got out the
great blue envelope containing the thin papers in the
case&mdash;they were as few as the young man&#8217;s friends&mdash;and
took them over to the Governor, but no sooner
had I laid them on his desk and made the first hesitating
and tentative approach to the subject, than I
divined the moment to be wholly inauspicious. The
Governor did not even look at the papers, he did not
even touch the big blue linen envelope, but shook
his head and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I will not pardon any more. The people
are opposed to it; they do not believe in mercy; they
love revenge; they want the prisoners punished to
the bitterest extremity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not then know how right he was in his cynical
generalization, though I did know that his decision
was so far from his own heart that it was no decision
at all, but merely the natural human reaction against
all the venom that had been voided upon him, and I
went away then, and told Brennan that we must wait
until the Governor was in another mood.</p>

<p>Three or four days afterward I met the Governor
one morning as he was passing through the rotunda
of the State House, his head bent in habitual abstraction,
and seeing me in what seemed always some
subconscious way he stopped and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way: that pardon case you spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the other morning&mdash;I was somewhat hasty I fear,
and out of humor. If you&#8217;ll get the papers I&#8217;ll see
what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew of course what could be done, and knew
then that it would be done, and I made haste to get
the papers, which had been kept on my desk awaiting
that propitious season which I had the faith to
feel would come sooner or later, though I had not
expected it to come quite so soon as that. I already
anticipated the gladness that would light up Brennan&#8217;s
good Irish face when I handed him the pardon
for his friend, and I could dramatize the scene in
that miner&#8217;s cottage in Braidwood when the pardoned
boy flew to his mother&#8217;s arms. I intended to
say nothing then to Brennan, however, but to wait
until the pardon, signed and sealed, could be delivered
into his hands, but as I was going across the
hall to the Governor&#8217;s chambers I encountered Brennan,
and then of course could not hold back the good
news. And so I told him, looking into his blue eyes
to behold the first ripple of the smile I expected to
see spread over his face; but there was no smile.
He regarded me quite soberly, shook his head, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he drew from his pocket a telegram, and,
without any need to read it, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He died last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the papers back and had them filed away
among those cases that had been finally disposed of,
though that formality could not dispose of the case
for me. The Governor was waiting for the papers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and at last when the morning had almost worn away
I went over to his chambers to add another fardel
to that heavy load which I had thought it was to be
my lot that day to see lightened in the doing of an
act of grace and pity. I told him as he sat alone
at his desk, and the shade of sorrow deepened a
moment on his pale face; but he said nothing, and
I was glad to go.</p>

<p>The poor little tragedy had its impressions for
me, and it was not long until I thought I saw in it
the motive of a story, which at once I began to write.
The theme was the embarrassment which a governor&#8217;s
conscience created for him because during a
critical campaign he knew it to be his duty to pardon
a notorious convict,&mdash;and I invented the situations
and expedients to bear the tale along to that thrilling
climax in which the governor was delivered out
of his difficulty by the most opportune death of the
convict, whom a higher hand could dramatically be
said to have pardoned. I worked very hard on the
story, and thought it pretty fine, and I sent it away
at last to an eastern magazine. And then I waited,
and at length a letter came saying that the story
was well enough thought of in that editorial room
to hold it until the editor-in-chief should return
from Europe and hand down a final decision. I
waited for weeks, and then one morning there on my
desk was an envelope, ominous in its bigness; it was
one of those letters you do not have to open in order
to read them, because you know what they say; I
knew my manuscript had come back. But when I
opened the package, instead of the familiar slip of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
rejection, there was a letter; the editor liked the
story, saw much in it, he said, but felt&mdash;and quite
rightly I am sure&mdash;that its ending, with the convict
dying in the very nick of time to save the governor
from his embarrassment, was an evasion of the whole
moral issue; besides, the conclusion was too melodramatic,&mdash;that
was the word he used,&mdash;and would I
change it?</p>

<p>The day after all was bright and cheerful; I
remember it well, the sun lying on the State House
lawns, their green dotted with the gold of dandelions,
and the trees twisting their leaves almost rapturously
in a sparkling air we did not often breathe
on those humid prairies. And&mdash;though this has
nothing whatever to do with the case, and enters it
only as one of those incidents that linger in the
memory&mdash;William Jennings Bryan was there that
day, calling on the Governor and the Secretary of
State. He was then a young congressman from
Nebraska, and he made a speech; but I was interested
in the story far more than in politics or any
speech about it, even the brilliant speech of a man
who so soon, and with such remarkable <i>&eacute;lan</i>, was to
charge across the country on the hosts of privilege.</p>

<p>And I changed the story; I made that poor harried
governor drain his bitter cup of duty to the lees,
and gave the story an ending so remorselessly logical,
so true to the facts and fates of human experience,
that it might have been as depressing as one of
Hardy&#8217;s &#8220;Little Ironies&#8221;&mdash;could it have resembled
them in any other way, which of course it could not,
unless it were in that imitation with which the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
author I had been reading was pretty sure though
all unconsciously to be flattered. I changed the
story, and sent the MS. back to the waiting editor;
and it was returned as the string snaps back to the
bow, with a letter that showed plainly that his interest
in the tale had all evaporated. He had no regrets,
it appeared, save one perhaps, since he concluded
his letter by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, you have destroyed the fine dramatic
ending which the story possessed in its first draft.&#8221;</p>

<p>The experience uprooted another of society&#8217;s oak-trees
for me, and it has continued to lie there, with
the roots of its infallibility withering whitely in the
air, though humanity still somehow continues to arrange
itself about the institution as best it can. This
process of uprooting, I suppose, goes on in life to the
very end; but it is wholesome after all, since life
grows somehow easier after one has learned that
human beings are all pretty human and pretty much
alike in their humanness, and the great service of
literature to mankind has been, and more and more
will be, I hope, to teach human beings this salutary
and consoling lesson.</p>

<p>But, in no way despairing, I kept the manuscript
by me, and when I was not trying to write other
stories I was retouching it, until in the end its fate
was almost that of the portrait which the artist in
one of Balzac&#8217;s stories kept on trying to improve
until it was but a meaningless scumble of gray, with
no likeness to anything in this universe. Its fate
was not quite that bad, however, since it made for me
a friend.</p>

<p>The incident, like that on which the story itself
was founded, occurred in the course of another effort
to induce the Governor to save a poor wretch from
the gallows. The autumn preceding, just when the
World&#8217;s Fair at Chicago was at its apogee, a half-crazed
boy had assassinated Carter Harrison, the old
mayor of that city, and had been promptly tried and
condemned to death. The time for the execution of
the sentence drew on, and two or three days before
the black event I had a telegram from Peter Dunne
and other newspaper friends in Chicago asking me to
urge the governor, or the acting governor as it
happened at that time to be, to commute the sentence
to one of imprisonment for life. The boy, so
the telegrams said, was clearly insane, and had been
at the time of his crazy and desperate deed; his case
had not been presented with the skill that might have
saved him, or at least might have saved another in
such a plight; there had been the customary hue and
cry, the most cherished process of the English law,
&#8220;and,&#8221; Dunne concluded, &#8220;do get Joe Gill to let
him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe Gill was Joseph B. Gill, the young Lieutenant-Governor
of the state, and because Governor Altgeld
was just then out of the state he was on the
bridge as acting governor. Gill had been one of the
Immortal 101, and as a representative had made a
record in support of certain humane measures in
behalf of the miners of the state. The newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
correspondents had had pleasure in celebrating him
and his work in their despatches, and because of his
popularity among the miners, to say nothing of his
popularity among the newspaper men, he had been
nominated for lieutenant-governor on the ticket
with Altgeld. There was in our relations a <i>camaraderie</i>
which put any thought of presumption out of
the question; besides, I was always so much opposed
to the killing of human beings, especially to that
peculiarly horrible form of killing which the state
deliberately and in cold blood commits under the
euphemism of &#8220;capital punishment,&#8221; that I was always
ready to ask any governor to commute a sentence
of death that had been pronounced against
anybody; so that it seemed a simple matter to
ask Joe Gill, himself the heart of kindness, to
save the life of this boy whose soul had wandered
so desperately astray in the clouds which darkened
it.</p>

<p>Early the next morning&mdash;the telegrams had come
at night&mdash;I went over to the governor&#8217;s office, and
the governor&#8217;s private secretary told me that Lieutenant-Governor
Gill had not yet appeared, and as a
good secretary, anxious to protect his chief, he
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to see him about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This Prendergast they&#8217;re going to hang in Chicago
next Friday.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this a man sitting in the room near the secretary&#8217;s
desk looked up with a sudden access of intense
interest; and, starting from his chair and
transfixing me with a sharp glance, he asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;What interest have you in the Prendergast
case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; I said, &#8220;except that I don&#8217;t want to
have him, or anybody, hanged.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the man&#8217;s face, tired, with the expression of
world-weariness life gives to the countenance behind
which there has been too much serious contemplation
of life, a face that seemed prematurely
wrinkled, there suddenly appeared a smile as winning
as a woman&#8217;s, and he said in a voice that had
the timbre of human sympathy and the humor of
a peculiar drawl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re all right, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>It thereupon occurred to the governor&#8217;s secretary
to introduce us, and so I made the acquaintance
of Clarence Darrow. He had taken it upon
himself to neglect his duties as the attorney of
some of the railroads and other large corporations
in Chicago long enough to come down to Springfield
on his own initiative and responsibility to plead
with the Governor for this lad&#8217;s life (he was always
going on some such Quixotic errand of mercy for
the poor and the friendless), and we retired to the
governor&#8217;s ante-chamber to await the coming of
Gill. We talked for a while about the Prendergast
case, which might have had more sympathetic consideration
had it not persisted as the Carter Harrison
case in the mind of that public, which when
its latent spirit of vengeance is aroused can so
easily become the mob, but it was not long until I
discovered that Darrow had read books other than
those of the law, and for an hour we talked of Tolstoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and the other great Russians, and of Thomas
Hardy and of Mr. Howells, to enumerate no more
of the long catalogue of those realists whom we
liked in common, and when I discovered that he
actually knew Mr. Howells, knew him personally, as
the saying is, I could feel that poor Prendergast,
though I had never seen him in my life, or scarcely
ever thought of him until the night before, had done
me one service at least, and it made me all the more
anxious to save him.</p>

<p>When Joe Gill&#8217;s tall Egyptian form came swinging
into the room our talk of books was interrupted
long enough to arrange for a hearing that afternoon,
and then we resumed our talk, and it endured
through luncheon and after, and I left him only
long enough to have a conversation with Gill and
to ask him as a sort of personal favor to an old
friend to spare the boy&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock the hearing was called. The reporters
and the governor&#8217;s secretary and George
Brennan and I made the audience, and Gill sat up
erectly in the governor&#8217;s chair to hear the appeal.
Darrow asked me the proper address for a governor,
and I said since this was the lieutenant-governor
I thought &#8220;Your Excellency&#8221; would be propitiative,
and Darrow made one of those eloquent
appeals for mercy of which he is the complete master.
It moved us all, but the Lieutenant-Governor
gathered himself together and refused it, and Darrow
went back to Chicago to unfold those legal
technicalities which make our law so superior to
other forms in that they can stay the hand of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
vengeance. He did not succeed in the end, and the
boy was hanged, and murder has gone on in Chicago
since, I understand, the same as before. But Darrow
could not leave Springfield until midnight of
that day, and we talked about books all the evening,
and when he boarded his train he had in his valise
the MS. of my story about another governor and
another pardon, concerning which he was charged
to answer a certain question to which all my doubts
and perplexities could be reduced, namely: &#8220;Is it
worth while, and if not, is there any use in going on
and trying to write one that is?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to wait almost as long for his decision as
though he had been an editor himself, but when I
called at his office in Chicago one morning in the
autumn to get the MS., and he told me that his answer
to my question was &#8220;yes,&#8221; and that he would,
if I agreed, send the story to Mr. Howells, I was as
happy as though he had been an editor and had accepted
it for publication. I could not agree to its
being sent on to weary Mr. Howells, but took it
back with me to Springfield, in hope, if not in confidence.</p>

</div>


<p>However, it has seemed to be my fate, or my
weakness, which we too often confuse with fate, to
vacillate between an interest in letters and an interest
in politics, and after that year, whose days
and nights were almost wholly given to studying
law, I was admitted to the bar, and thereupon felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
qualified to go out on the stump in the campaign that
autumn and speak in behalf of the Democratic ticket.
It was fun to drive out over Sangamon County in
those soft autumn evenings, over the soft roads,&mdash;though
if it rained they became too soft,&mdash;and to
speak in schoolhouses to the little audiences of farmers,
or of miners, on the iniquities of the tariff. If we
had been a little more devoted to principle, perhaps,
than we were to party, we might better have spoken
of the iniquities of that Democratic minority in
the Senate which had just completed its betrayal
of us all and helped to perpetrate those iniquities,
but when you belong to a party you are presumed
to adjust yourself to what your representatives do,
and to make the best of what generally is a pretty
bad bargain. The bargain of those senators had
been particularly bad, and so, instead of speaking
in the tones of righteous indignation, we had to
adopt the milder accents of apology and explanation,
and it was difficult to explain to some of those
audiences. There was more or less heckling, and
now and then impromptu little debates, and sometimes
when the meeting was done, and we started on
the long ride back to town, we would find that the
nuts had been removed from the axles of our carriage-wheels.
Perhaps that argument was as good
as any we had made, and it could not matter much
anyway, since partizan speeches never convince anybody,
and if they could, if they could do anything
but deepen and intensify prejudice, whole batteries
of the world&#8217;s best orators in that year could not
have overcome the vicious effects of that high betrayal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
even though they had been led to the charge
by Phocion and Demosthenes.</p>

<p>I suppose no greater moral wrong was ever committed
in America. It had been bad enough that
a policy of favoritism and advantage which appealed
to so many because of the good luck of its
reassuring name, had endured so long, as a sort of
necessity in the development of a new continent; it
had been bad enough that labor had first been lied to
and then subjugated by the lie, that women had
been driven into mills, and children had been fed to
the Moloch of the machines, and that on these sacrifices
there had been reared in America an insolent
plutocracy with the ideals of a gambler and the
manners of a wine-agent. But when the workingmen
had learned at last that the system did not
&#8220;protect&#8221; them, and when thousands of young men
in the land, filled with the idealism of youth, had
recognized the lie and the hypocrisy, and hated them
with a fine moral abhorrence, and had turned to the
Democratic party and trusted it to redeem its promise
to reform this evil, and had put it in power in
the nation, only to have its leaders in the Senate
betray them with the brutal cynicism such a cause
as theirs demands, then there was committed a deed
little short of dastardly. If that seems too strong a
word, the deed was surely contemptible, and base
enough to fill anyone with despair of the party and
of the party system as it had been developed in
America, though it has been understood by only two
men so far as I know&mdash;M. Ostrogorski and Golden
Rule Jones. It was enough to disgust anyone with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
politics altogether, and to forswear them and
parties, too, although I never quite understood the
philosophy of the attitude until, a few years later,
Golden Rule Jones made it clear. He made many
things clear, for he dropped the plummet of his original
mind down, down, down, more profoundly into
fundamental life than anyone I can think of.</p>

<p>To me, in those days, the tariff question had
seemed entirely fundamental. I used to think that
if we could but have civil-service reform, and tariff
for revenue only, the world would go very well. The
tariff question is not considered fundamental in
these days, of course, so fast and so far past the
Mugwumps has the world run, though everybody realizes
its evil, and knows, or should know, that the
notion of privilege on which tariffs are founded is
quite fundamentally wrong, and every political party
promises to reduce its rates, or revise them, or at
least to take some measures against the lie.</p>

<p>The Democratic party, to be sure, redeemed itself
later under the splendid leadership of President Wilson,
but at that time, while we recognized the evil of
the theory, we seemed to have sunk into a sordid
acquiescence in the fact; everybody thought the
tariff wrong, but nobody wished to have it done away
with so long as there was a chance, to speak in modern
American, for him to get in on the graft. The
word &#8220;graft&#8221; was unknown in those days, by all save
those thieves in whose argot it was found and devoted
to its present general use in the vocabulary.
I suppose it is in the dictionary by this time. In
any event, it is not strange that the word should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
have become so current, since for a while we made
a national institution of the very thing it connotes.</p>

<p>There was, however, then and always, the labor
question, and we were beginning to discover that
that is fundamental, perhaps the one great fundamental,&mdash;aside
from the complication of evil and
good that is inherent and implicit in humanity itself,&mdash;since
the burning question is and always will
be how the work of the world is to be got done, and,
what is a much more embarrassing problem, who is
to do it. Many of the men who had been doing that
work, or the heaviest of it, were striking in Illinois
in those years.</p>

<p>The shots the Pinkertons had fired at Homestead
echoed in the state; Senator Palmer had made a
great speech about it in the Senate; and perhaps
the tariff had something to do with that, since tariffs
on steel have not been unknown. But there were
shots fired nearer home, first in the strike among
the men who were digging the drainage canal, then
among the miners in the soft coal fields of the state,
then the strike in the model town of Pullman, and
the great railroad strike that grew out of it.</p>

<p>They called it the Debs Rebellion, and for a while
it assumed some of the proportions of a rebellion,
or at least it frightened many people in Illinois as
much as a rebellion might have done. We were in
the midst of all its alarms during that whole spring
and summer, and down in the adjutant-general&#8217;s
office at the State House there was the stir almost
of war itself, with troops being ordered here and
there about the state, and the Governor harried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and worried by a situation that presented to him
the abhorrent necessity of using armed force. I was
reading over the other day the report made to the
War Department by my friend Major Jewett Baker,
then a lieutenant in the Twelfth U. S. Infantry,
detailed with the National Guard of Illinois; and
in his clear and excellent account of all those confused
events the scenes of those times came back:
the long lines of idle freight cars, charred by incendiary
flames; the little groups of men standing
about wearing the white ribbons of the strike sympathizers,
and the colonel of the regular army, in
his cups at his club, who wished he might order a
whole regiment to shoot them, &#8220;each man to take
aim at a dirty white ribbon&#8221;; the regulars encamped
on the lake front, their sentinels pacing
their posts at the quickstep in the rain; and then
that morning conference in the mayor&#8217;s office in Chicago,
at which I was permitted to look on&mdash;what an
interesting life it is to look on at!&mdash;when there appeared
Eugene V. Debs, tall, lithe, nervous, leader of
the strikers, his hair, what there was of it, sandy, but
his head mostly bald, his eyes flashing, his mouth
ready to smile, soon to go to Woodstock Jail, to
emerge a Socialist, and become the leader of that
party.</p>

<p>Major Baker&#8217;s report shows, indirectly and by inference,
that much of the criticism which the Governor
endured was not justified, since he turned out
all his troops as fast as local authorities asked for
them. At any rate, he acted according to his democratic
principles and to his conception of his duty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
His principles were in a sense different from those
of President Cleveland, with whom he disagreed in
that notable instance when the President in his vigorous,
practical way sent federal troops into Chicago;
the Governor protested, as one of his predecessors
in the governor&#8217;s office, Senator Palmer, had
protested when President Grant sent federal troops
under Phil Sheridan into Chicago at the time of the
great fire. Almost everybody who had any way of
making his voice heard sided with President Cleveland,
and the end of the strike was accredited to
him. Doubtless the grim presence of those regular
troops did overawe the hoodlums who had taken advantage
of the strike to create disorder, but if the
credit must go to armed force, the report by Major,
or, as he was in those days, Lieutenant, Baker shows
that that little company of the Illinois National
Guard which ruthlessly fired into the mob at Loomis
Street one night virtually ended the disorder.</p>

<p>Perhaps Governor Altgeld was willing to forego
any &#8220;credit&#8221; for an act, which, however necessary
to the preservation of order, demanded so many
lives. I do not know as to that, but I do recall the
expression which clouded his face that afternoon
we arrived at Lemont, during the strike at the drainage
canal. It occurred a year before the railway
strike, and the Governor had gone to Lemont himself
to make an investigation. He had asked Lieutenant
Baker and me to go with him, and when we
got off the train at Lemont, on the afternoon of
a cheerless day, the crowds were standing aimlessly
about, watching with a sullen curiosity the arrival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
of the militia. The soldiers were just then going
into camp on the level rocks by a bridge across the
canal and the Desplaines River&mdash;the bridge, according
to the military scientists, was, I believe, considered,
for some mysterious reason, to be a strategic
point.</p>

<p>The picture was one for the brush of Remington&mdash;those
young blue-clad soldiers (it was before the
days of our imperialism, and of the khaki our soldiers
now imitate the British in wearing)&mdash;and
Baker and I stood and gazed at it a moment, affected
by the fascination there always is in the
superficial military spectacle; and then, suddenly,
we were aware that there was another and more
dramatic point of interest, where a group stood
about the body of a workman who had been shot in
the riots of that morning. He was a foreigner,
the clothes he wore doubtless those he had had on
when he passed under the Statue of Liberty, coming
to this land with what hopes of freedom in his
breast no one can ever know. The wife who had
come with him was on her knees beside him, rocking
back and forth in her grief, dumb as to any words
in a strange land whose tongue she could not speak
or understand.</p>

<p>The reporters from the Chicago newspapers were
there, and among them Eddie Bernard, an old
Whitechapeler, who told us that the man had
reached Lemont only a few days before, and had
been happy in the job he had so promptly found
in the new land of promise. And now, there he
lay, shot dead. Bernard looked a moment, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
in the irony of a single phrase he expressed the
whole drama as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The land of the free and the home of the brave!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was fundamental, anyhow, and politics were
not going deeply into the question, except as such
men as Altgeld did so, and even they were criticized
sharply for attempting it. And one might well
be disgusted with politics, then and always, and
think of something that has the consolation of literature.
The traffic of politicians, as Mr. George Moore
somewhere says, is with the things of this world,
while art is concerned with the dreams, the visions
and the aspirations of a world beyond this. Though
literature must some day in this land concern itself
with that very question of labor, since it is with fundamental
life that art must deal, and be true in its
dealing.</p>

<p>Politics in those days&mdash;and not alone in those days
either&mdash;were mean, and while I do not intend to say
that this meanness bowed me with despair, it did fill
me with disgust, and made the whole business utterly
distasteful. Politics were almost wholly personal,
there was then no conception of them as related to
social life. An awakening was coming, to be sure,
and the signs were then apparent, even if but few saw
them. They were to most quite dim; but there were
here and there in the land dreamers of a sort, who
had caught a new vision. The feeling of it, the emotion,
was to find expression in Mr. Bryan&#8217;s great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
campaign in 1896; but there was then in Chicago a
little group, men who had read Henry George, or,
without reading him, had looked out on life intelligently
and gained a concept of it, or perhaps had
merely felt in themselves the stirrings of a new social
instinct, and these saw, or thought they saw, the way
to a better social order. They could not in those
days gain so patient a hearing for their views as they
have since, if any hearing they have had may after
all be called patient; they were not so very patient
themselves, perhaps, as men are quite apt not to be
when they think they see as clearly as though a perpetual
lightning blazed in the sky exactly what is the
matter with the world, and have a simple formula,
which, were it but tried, would instantly and infallibly
make everything all right.</p>

<p>But these men were not in politics; some of them
were too impractical ever to be, and the only man
in politics who understood them at all was Altgeld.
Generally, the moral atmosphere of politics was foul
and heavy with the feculence of all the debauchery
that is inseparable from privilege. The personnel
of politics was generally low; and in city councils
and state legislatures there was a cynical contempt
of all the finer sentiments. It was not alone that
provincialism and philistinism which stand so obdurately
and with such bovine stupidity in the way
of progress; there was a positive scorn of the virtues,
and the alliance between the lobbyists and the lawyers
of the great corporation interests on the one hand,
and the managers of both the great political parties
on the other, was a fact, the worst feature of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
was that no one seemed to care, or if a few did care,
they did not know what to do about it. It was a
joke among the newspaper men, who had little respect
for the men who filled the positions of power
and responsibility; the wonder was, indeed, after
such association, that they had any respect left for
anything in the world. Only the other day, reading
Walt Whitman&#8217;s terrific arraignment of the powers
that were in control of the government of the nation
in Buchanan&#8217;s time, his awful catalogue of the sorts
of men who composed the directorate of affairs,&mdash;it
may be read in his prose works by those who wish,&mdash;I
was struck by the similarity in this respect of that
time with that which immediately preceded the newer
and better time of the moral awakening in America.
Altgeld was one of the forerunners of this time; and,
in accordance with the universal law of human nature,
it was his fate to be misunderstood and ridiculed
and hated, even by many in his own party. He
was far in the van in most ways, so far that it was
impossible for his own party to follow him. It did
not follow him in his opposition to a bill which was
passed in the General Assembly to permit of the
consolidation of gas companies in Chicago; the machines
of the two parties were working well together
in the legislature&mdash;in one of those bipartizan alliances
which were not to be understood until many
years later, and even then not to be understood so
very clearly, since most of our cities have been governed
since by such alliances, in the interest of similar
gas companies and other public utility corporations&mdash;and
when the Governor vetoed their evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
measure, this same bipartizan machine sought to
pass it over his veto, and none was more active in
the effort than were the leaders of his own party in
the House.</p>

<p>The supreme effort was made on the last night
of the session, amidst one of those riots which mark
the dissolution of our deliberative legislative bodies.
The lobbyists for the measure were quite shameless
that night, as they were on most nights, no doubt;
almost as shameless as the legislators themselves.
The House was in its shirt-sleeves; and there was
the rude horse-play of country bumpkins; paper
wads were flying, now and then some member
sent hurtling through the hot air his file of
printed legislative bills, and all the while there was
that confusion of sound, laughter, and oaths and
snatches of song, a sort of bedlam, in which laws
were being enacted&mdash;laws that must be respected
and even revered, because of their sacred origin.
The leaders were serious, but worried; the expressions
of their drawn, tense, nervous faces were unhappy
in suspicion and fear, and, perhaps, because
of uneasy consciences. The speaker sat above them,
pale and haggard, rapping his splintered sounding-board
with a broken gavel, rapping persistently and
futilely. And as the time drew near when the gas bill
was to come on for consideration, the nervous tension
was intensified, and evil hung almost palpably
in the hot, close air of that chamber. Those who
have had experience of legislative bodies, and have
by practice learned something of political a&euml;roscopy,
can always tell when &#8220;something is coming off&#8221;;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
political correspondents have cultivated the sense,
and that night they could have divined nothing good
or pure or beautiful in that chamber (where the
portraits of Lincoln and of Douglas hung), unless
it were the mellow music, now and then, of the glass
prisms of the chandeliers hanging high from the
garish ceiling, as they tinkled and chimed whenever
some little breeze wandered in from the June night.</p>

<p>And yet there was beauty there, moral beauty, as
there ever is somewhere in man. Out on the edge
of that bedlam, standing under the gallery on the
Democratic side, near the cloak-room, stood a tall,
lank man. You would have known him at once, anywhere,
as an Egyptian, as we called those who had
come from the Illinois land south of the old O. &amp; M.
railroad. He was uncouth in appearance; he wore
drab, ill-fitting clothes, and at his wrinkled throat
there was no collar. He was a member, sent there
from some rural district far down in the southern end
of the state; and all through the session he had been
silent, taking no part, except to vote, and to vote,
on most occasions, with his party, which, in those
days, was the whole duty of man. This night would
see the end of his political career, if his brief experience
in an obscure position could be called a
career, and he stood there, silently looking on,
plucking now and then at his chin, his long, wrinkled
face brown and solemn and inscrutable.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian stood there while the long roll
was being called, and the crisis approached, and
the nervous tension was a keen pain. And suddenly
one of the gas lobbyists went up to him, there on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the verge of the House, and began to talk with him.
I had the story a good while afterwards from one
of the whips, who, it seemed, knew all that had gone
on that night. The lobbyist of course knew about
the man, knew especially about his necessities, as
lobbyists do; and he began to talk to the old fellow
about them&mdash;about his poverty and his children,
and he used the old argument which has been employed
so long and so successfully with the rural
members of all our legislatures, and has been the
source of so much evil in our city governments, that
is, the argument that the bill concerned only Chicago,
and that the folks down home would neither
know nor care how he voted on it, and then&mdash;how
much two thousand dollars would mean to him. As
the lobbyist talked, there were various eyes that
looked at him, waiting for a sign; they needed only
a few votes then, and the roll-call was being delayed
by one pretense and another, and the clock on the
wall, inexorably ticking toward the hour of that
legislature&#8217;s dissolution, was turned back. The old
fellow listened and stroked his chin, and then presently,
when the lobbyist had done, he turned his
old blue eyes on him and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re right: I&#8217;m poor, and I&#8217;ve got a
big family. And you&#8217;re right, too, when you say
my people won&#8217;t know nor care: they won&#8217;t; they
don&#8217;t know nor care a damn; they won&#8217;t send me
back here, of course. And God knows what&#8217;s to
come of my wife and my children; I am going home
to them to-morrow and on Monday I&#8217;m going to
hunt me a job in the harvest-field; I reckon I&#8217;ll die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
in the poorhouse. Yes, I&#8217;m going home&mdash;but&#8221;&mdash;he
stopped and looked the lobbyist in the eye&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
going home an honest man.&#8221;</p>

<p>My friend the whip told me the story as a curious
and somewhat confusing flaw in his theory that
every man is for sale,&mdash;&#8220;most of them damned
cheap,&#8221; he said,&mdash;and he thought it might make a
plot for a story; like many men I have known he
was incorrigibly romantic, and was always giving
me plots for stories. Well, they failed to pass the
bill over the Governor&#8217;s veto, and it was not long
until another story was pretty well known in Illinois,
about that Governor who that night was sitting up
over in the executive mansion, awaiting the action
of the general assembly. The story was that a
large quantity of the bonds of the gas company had
been placed at his disposal in a security vault in
Chicago, in a box to which a man was to deliver
him the key; all he had to do was to go take the
bonds&mdash;and permit the bill to become a law. His
answer, of course, was the veto&mdash;an offense as unpardonable
as the pardoning of the anarchists; and
no doubt many such offenses against the invisible
power in the land were more potent in bringing down
on his head that awful hatred than his mercy had
been&mdash;though this was made to serve as reason for
the hatred. Privilege, of course, hates mercy, too.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian went back home, and I have
always hoped that he found a better job than he
went to seek in the harvest-fields, and that he did
not die at last to the poorhouse; but he was never
heard of more, and it was not long until the Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was driven from his office amid the hoots and
jeers and the hissing of a venomous hatred such as
nothing but political rancor knows, unless it be religious
rancor. Yes, politics had got pretty low in
those days, and its utter meanness, gradually revealed,
was enough to cause one to despair of his
country and his kind. Perhaps the old Egyptian
in the legislature and the idealist in the governor&#8217;s
chair should have been enough to keep one from despairing
altogether, though one honest old peasant
cannot save a legislature any more than one swallow
can make a summer. I do not mean to say that
he was the only honest man in the legislature: there
were many others, of course, but partizan politics
prevented their honesty from being of much avail;
or, at any rate, they did not control events. With
the measurable advance in thought since that time,
and the general progress of the species, we know
now that men do not control events half so much
as events control men; we do not know exactly what
it is that does control men&mdash;that is, those of us who
are not Socialists do not know.</p>

<p>Altgeld, at any rate, was disgusted with politics,
as well he might have been, since they wrecked his
fortune and broke his heart. And it was with relief,
I know, that he said that morning,&mdash;almost the
last he passed in the governor&#8217;s chair,&mdash;as he and
I were going up the long walk to the State House
steps:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re rid of this, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>That peculiar form of human activity, or inactivity,
known as getting a law practice, has been
so abundantly treated on the printed page that I
have not the temerity to add to the literature on
the interesting subject. The experience is never
dramatic, even if it is sometimes tragic, and it is
so often tragic that there has seemed no other recourse
for mankind than, by one of those tacit understandings
on which our race gets through life, to
view it as a comedy. It is no comedy, of course,
to the chief actor, who is sustained only by his
dreams, his illusions, and his ideals, and he may
count himself successful perhaps, if, when he has lost
his illusions, he can retain at least some of his ideals,
though the law is too apt to strip him of both.
However that may be, in my own experience in that
sort there was an incident which made its peculiar
impressions; indeed, there were several such incidents,
but the one which I have in mind involves the
perhaps commonplace story of Maria R&mdash;&mdash;, which
ran like a serial during those trying years.</p>

<p>I had intended to take up the practice of law
in Chicago; I was quite certain that there I should
set up my little enterprise, and this self-same certainty
is perhaps the reason why I found myself
back in Toledo, in a lonely little office in one of the
new office buildings; sky-scrapers they were called
in the new sense of metropolitan life that then began
to pervade the town; they were not so very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
high, but they seemed high enough to scrape the
low skies which arch so many of the grey days in
the lake region. It was as long ago, I believe, as
the time of Pythagoras that the law of the certain
uncertainty of certainty was deduced for the humbling
of human pride, and when my certainties with
regard to Chicago proved all to be broken reeds,
there were more gray days in that region of the
intemperate zone than the meteorological records
show. The little law office had a portrait of William
Dean Howells on its walls, and in time the portraits
of other writers, differing from those other
law offices which prefer to be adorned with pictures
of Chief Justice Marshall&mdash;a strong man, of course,
who wrote some strong fiction, too, in his day&mdash;and
of Hamilton and of Jefferson, indicating either a
catholicity or a confusion of principle on the part
of the occupying proprietor, of which usually he is
not himself aware. There were a few law-books, too,
and on the desk a little digest of the law of evidence
as affected by the decisions of the Ohio courts. I
had the noble intention of mastering it, but I did
not read in it very much, since for a long while
there was no one to pay me for doing so, and I
spent most of my hours at my desk over a manuscript
of &#8220;The 13th District,&#8221; a novel of politics I
was then writing, looking up now and then and gazing
out of the window at the blank rear walls of certain
brick buildings which made a dreary prospect,
even if one of them did bear, as I well remember, the
bright and reassuring legend, &#8220;Money to Loan at 6
per cent.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>There were not many interruptions at first, but
after a while, when I had been appointed as attorney
to a humane society, there were times when I
had to lay my manuscripts aside. I felt it to be, in
a way, my duty to long for such interruptions, but
they usually came just at those times when I was
most absorbed in my manuscript, so that their welcome,
while affectedly polite, was not wholly from
the heart. One of these intrusions resulted in a
long trial before a justice of the peace; it was a
case that grew out of a neighborhood quarrel, and
all the inhabitants of the <i>locus in quo</i> were subp&#339;naed
as witnesses. Such a case of course always
affords an opportunity to study human nature; but
this one, too, had the effect ultimately of bringing
in many clients&mdash;and, as Altgeld had said, by way
of advice to me, got people in the habit of coming
to my office. Those witnesses acquired that habit,
and since human nature seemed to run pretty high
in that neighborhood most of the time, they got into
a good deal of trouble; they were most of them so
poor that they seldom got into anything else, unless
it were the jail or the workhouse, and some of them
were always ready to help send others of them to
those places. Out of the long file of poor miserable
creatures there emerged one day that Maria R&mdash;&mdash;
of whom I spoke. She was a buxom young German
emigrant, not long over from Pomerania, and her
fair skin and yellow hair, and a certain manner she
had, marked her out from all the rest. She came
with her children one morning to complain of her
husband&#8217;s neglect of them; and to her, as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
whole body of society which thinks no more deeply
than she did, it seemed the necessary, proper, and
even indispensable thing to put Rheinhold&mdash;that was
her husband&#8217;s name&mdash;in jail (You should have
heard her speak the name Rheinhold, with that delicious
note in which she <i>grass&eacute;y&eacute;d</i> her r&#8217;s.) There
she sat, on the little chair by the window, with her
stupidly staring boy and girl at her knees, but in
her arms the brightest, prettiest, flaxen-haired baby
in the world, a little elf who was always smiling,
and picking at her mother&#8217;s nose or cheeks with
her fat little fingers, and when she smiled, her
mother smiled, too; it was the only time she ever
did.</p>

<p>Rheinhold of course drank; he &#8220;mistreated&#8221; his
children&mdash;that is, he did not buy them food. And
since the Humane Society was organized and maintained
for the explicit purpose of forcing people to
be humane, even though it had to be inhumane to
accomplish its purpose, the duty of its attorney was
clear.</p>

<p>Its attorney just then felt in himself a rising indignation,
moral of course, yet very much like a
vulgar anger. To look at those children, especially
at that baby of which Maria was so fond, much
fonder it was plain to be seen than of the other
two, and to think of a man not providing for them,
was to have a rage against him, the rage which society,
so remorselessly moral in the mass, bears
against all offenders&mdash;the rage a good prosecutor
must keep alive and flaming in his breast if he
would nerve himself to his task and earn his fees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and society&#8217;s gratitude. And whom does society reward
so lavishly as her prosecutors?</p>

<p>However, that is not the strain I would adopt
just now. I felt that very rage in myself at that
moment, and straightway went and had Rheinhold
arrested and haled before a judge in the Municipal
Court, charged with the crime of neglecting his children.
I can remember his wild and bewildered look
as he was arraigned that morning. The information
was read to him, and he moved his head in
such instant acquiescence that the judge, looking
down from his bench, asked him if he wished to plead
guilty, and he said &#8220;Yes.&#8221; It seemed then that
the case was to be quite easily disposed of, and the
prosecutor might feel gratified by this instant success
of his work; and yet Rheinhold stood there so
confused, so frightened, with the court-room loungers
looking on, that I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t understand a word of all you are
saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the judge entered a plea of &#8220;not guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew a young lawyer with rather large leisure,
and I asked him to defend Rheinhold. He was glad
to do so, and we empaneled a jury and went at what
Professor Wigmore calls the &#8220;high-class sport.&#8221; We
became desperately interested of course, and for
days wrangled according to the rules of the game
over the liberty of the bewildered little German who
scarcely knew what it was all about. Now and then
he made some wild, inarticulate protest, but was
of course promptly silenced by his own lawyer, or
by the judge, or by the rules of evidence, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
could be invoked&mdash;with a deep sense of satisfaction
when the court ruled your way&mdash;to prevent him
from telling something he had on his mind, something
that to him seemed entirely exculpatory, something
that would make the whole clouded situation
clear if it could only find its way to the light and
to the knowledge of mankind.</p>

<p>There was a witness against him, a tall, slender
young German shoemaker, and it was against him
that Rheinhold&#8217;s outcries were directed. It was
not clear just what he was trying to say, and there
was small disposition to help him make it clear.
His lawyer indeed seemed embarrassed, as though in
making his incoherent interruptions Rheinhold were
committing a <i>contretemps</i>; he must wait for his
turn to testify, that all might be done in order and
according to the ancient rules and precedents, and,
in a word, as it should be done. Under the rules
of evidence, of course, Rheinhold could not be allowed
to express his opinion of the shoemaker; that
was not permissible. The court could not be concerned
with the passions of the human heart; this
man before the court had a family, and he had neglected
to provide food for it, and for such a condition
it was written and printed in a book that the
appropriate remedy was a certain number of days
or months in the workhouse.</p>

<p>And so while Rheinhold silently and philosophically
acquiesced, we tried him during one whole day,
we argued nearly all the next day to the jury, and
the jury stayed out all that night and in the
morning returned a verdict of guilty. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Rheinhold was sent to the workhouse for nine
months.</p>

<p>It was regarded as a triumph for the Humane
Society,&mdash;the newspapers had printed accounts of
the trial,&mdash;but it was a victory of which I felt pretty
much ashamed; it all seemed so useless, so absurd,
so barbarous, when you came to think of it, and
what good it had done Maria, or anyone, it was
difficult to determine. And so, before very long, I
went to the workhouse board and had Rheinhold
paroled, and he disappeared, vanished toward the
West, and was never heard of more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maria lived on in her little house as
best she could, and with what assistance we could
provide her. The Humane Society helped a little,
and my wife made some clothes for the baby, and
a good-natured doctor in the neighborhood attended
them when they were sick, which was a good
deal of the time; and Maria seemed happy enough
and contented, relying with such entire confidence
on her friends that one cold night she sent for me
in great urgency, and when I arrived she pointed
to the stove, which was smoking and not doing its
work in a satisfactory manner at all. I mended it
and got the fire going, and they managed to survive
the winter; and when spring came Maria appeared
at the office and wished to apply to the courts
for a divorce. It seemed as good a thing to do as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
any, and the evidence of Rheinhold&#8217;s cruel neglect
was by this time so conclusive that it was not much
trouble to obtain a decree, especially as the case
came before a delightful old bachelor judge who felt
that if people were not divorced they ought to be;
and after listening to two of the five or six witnesses
I had subp&#339;naed he granted Maria her freedom.</p>

<p>And the next day she got married again. The
bridegroom was that very shoemaker who had testified
in Rheinhold&#8217;s trial; he lived not far from Maria&#8217;s
late residence, and the happy event, as I
learned then, was the culmination of a romance
which had disturbed Rheinhold to such a degree that
he had preferred to be anywhere rather than at
home; and it seemed now&mdash;it was now indeed quite
clear&mdash;that what he had been trying to explain at
the time of the trial was that his fate was involved in
the eternal triangle.</p>

<p>I do not know where Rheinhold is now; as I said,
he was never heard of more, but I should like to
present my apologies to him and to inform him that
as a result of that expedition into the jungle of the
law in search of justice I discovered that whatever
other men might do, I could never again prosecute
anyone for anything; and I never did. And I think
that most of the attempts men make to do justice
in their criminal courts are about as mistaken, about
as absurd, about as ridiculous, as that solemn and
supremely silly effort we made to deal with such
a human complication by means of calf-bound law-books,
and wrangling lawyers, and twelve stupid
jurors ranged behind twelve spittoons. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
whole experience revealed to me the beauty and the
truth in that wise passage in Mr. Howells&#8217;s charming
book, &#8220;A Boy&#8217;s Town&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, it seems best to be very careful how we
try to do justice in this world, and mostly to leave
retribution of all kinds to God, who really knows
about things; and content ourselves as much as possible
with mercy, whose mistakes are not so irreparable.&#8221;</p>

<p>That passage, I think, contains a whole and entirely
adequate philosophy of life; but I suppose
that those who shake their heads at such heresies
will be equally shocked to learn that Maria&#8217;s second
venture proved to be a remarkable success.</p>

<p>The shoemaker was a frugal chap,&mdash;the evidence
discloses, I think, that he had been an unusually
frugal lover,&mdash;and he had saved some money, which,
it seems, he was determined not to spend on his fair
one until he could develop some legal claim to her,
but he treated her handsomely then, according to his
taste and ability. He bought a house in another
and better part of town, and he furnished it in a
way that dazzled the eyes of those children who
had been accustomed to bare floors and had never
known the glories of golden oak and blue and yellow
and red plush, ingrain carpets, and chenille
hangings; and he clothed them all and sent them
to school, and finally they all took his name, and, I
think, forgot poor Rheinhold altogether. And so,
in their new-found prosperity, they vanished out of
my sight, and I heard of them no more for years.
Then one day Maria&#8217;s little daughter, grown into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
tall young girl by that time, came to tell me that
her mother was dead. Maria had started down town
with her husband, on Christmas Eve, to buy the gifts
for her children, and in the heavy snow that was
falling a defective sidewalk was hidden, and Maria
was thrown to the ground and so hurt that she died.
Her last words to her daughter had been, so the
girl said, &#8220;See Mr. Whitlock; he&#8217;ll do what should
be done.&#8221; Her heirs had a clear case against the
city, but I had just been elected mayor that autumn
and could not prosecute such a claim. Another lawyer
did so, and got damages for the children, and
even for the husband, and with these funds in a
trust company&#8217;s keeping the shoemaker educated
all the children. And he wore about his hat the
thickest hand of heavy cr&ecirc;pe that I ever saw.</p>

<p>It seemed to annoy, and in some cases even to
anger, those whom I told of my resolution not to
prosecute anyone any more. They would argue
about it with me as if it made some real difference
to them; if every lawyer and every man were so to
decide, they said, who was to proceed against the
criminals, who was to do the work of purifying and
regenerating society? It has always been, of course,
a most interesting and vital question as to who is
to do the dirty work of all kinds in this world; but
their apprehensions, as I could assure them, were
all unfounded, since there are always plenty of lawyers,
and always plenty of them who are not only
willing but anxious to act as prosecutors, and to
put into their work that energy and enthusiasm
which the schools of efficiency urge upon the youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
of the land, and to prosecute with a ferocity that
could be no more intense if they had suffered some injury
in their own persons from the accused. And
there are even men who are willing, for the most
meager salaries, to act as guards and wardens in
prisons, and to do all manner of things, even to commit
crimes, or at least moral wrongs, in order to put
men into prison and keep them there, unless they
can kill them, and there are plenty who are willing
to do that, if only society provides them with a rope
or a wire to do it with.</p>

<p>There was, however, in Toledo one man who could
sympathize with my attitude; and that was a man
whose determination to accept literally and to try to
practice the fundamental philosophy of Christianity
had so startled and confounded the Christians
everywhere that he at once became famous throughout
Christendom as &#8220;Golden Rule Jones.&#8221; I had
known of him only as the eccentric mayor of our city,
and nearly everyone whom I had met since my advent
in Toledo spoke of him only to say something disparaging
of him. The most charitable thing they
said was that he was crazy. All the newspapers
were against him, and all the preachers. My own
opinion, of course, could have been of no consequence,
but I had learned in the case of Altgeld that
almost universal condemnation of a man is to be
examined before it is given entire credit. I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
mean to say that there was universal condemnation
of Golden Rule Jones in Toledo in those days: it
was simply that the institutional voices of society,
the press and the pulpit, were thundering in condemnation
of him. When the people came to vote
for his re&euml;lection his majorities were overwhelming,
so that he used to say that everybody was against
him but the people. But that is another story.</p>

<p>In those days I had not met him. I might have
called at his office, to be sure, but I did not care to
add to his burdens. One day, suddenly, as I was
working on a story in my office, in he stepped with
a startling, abrupt manner, wheeled a chair up to
my desk, and sat down. He was a big Welshman
with a sandy complexion and great hands that had
worked hard in their time, and he had an eye that
looked right into the center of your skull. He wore,
and all the time he was in the room continued to
wear, a large cream-colored slouch hat, and he had
on the flowing cravat which for some inexplicable
reason artists and social reformers wear; their affinity
being due, no doubt, to the fact that the reformer
must be an artist of a sort, else he could not dream
his dreams. I was relieved, however, to find that
Jones wore his hair clipped short, and there was
still about him that practical air of the very practical
business man he had been before he became
mayor. He had been such a practical business man
that he was worth half a million, a fairly good fortune
for our town; but he had not been in office very
long before all the business men were down on him,
and saying that what the town needed was a business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
man for mayor, a statement that was destined
to ring in my ears for a good many years. They
disliked him of course because he would not do just
what they told him to,&mdash;that being the meaning
and purpose of a business man for mayor,&mdash;but insisted
that there were certain other people in the
city who were entitled to some of his service and
consideration&mdash;namely, the working people and the
poor. The politicians and the preachers objected
to him on the same grounds: the unpardonable sin
being to express in any but a purely ideal and sentimental
form sympathy for the workers or the poor.
It seemed to be particularly exasperating that he
was doing all this in the name of the Golden Rule,
which was for the Sunday-school; and they even
went so far as to bring to town another Sam Jones,
the Reverend Sam Jones, to conduct a &#8220;revival&#8221; and
to defeat the Honorable Sam Jones. The Reverend
Sam Jones had big meetings, and said many clever
things, and many true ones, the truest among them
being his epigram, &#8220;I am for the Golden Rule myself,
up to a certain point, and then I want to take
the shotgun and the club.&#8221; I think that expression
marked the difference between him and our Sam
Jones, in whose philosophy there was no place at
all for the shotgun or the club. The preachers were
complaining that Mayor Jones was not using shotguns,
or at least clubs, on the &#8220;bad&#8221; people in the
town; I suppose that since their own persuasions
had in a measure failed, they felt that the Mayor
with such instruments might have made the &#8220;bad&#8221;
people look as if they had been converted anyway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>It was when he was undergoing such criticism as
this that he came to see me, to ask me to speak at
Golden Rule Park. This was a bit of green grass
next to his factory; he had dedicated it to the
people&#8217;s use, and there under a large willow-tree,
on Sunday afternoons, he used to speak to hundreds.
There was a little piano which two men could
carry, and with that on the platform to play the
accompaniments the people used to sing songs that
Jones had written&mdash;some of them of real beauty, and
breathing the spirit of poetry, if they were not always
quite in its form. In the winter these meetings
were held in Golden Rule Hall, a large room
that served very well as an auditorium, in his factory
hard by. On the walls of Golden Rule Hall
was the original tin sign he had hung up in his
factory as the only rule to be known there, &#8220;Therefore
whatsoever things ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them.&#8221; In the course
of time every reformer, every radical, in the country
had spoken in that hall or under that willow-tree,
and the place developed an atmosphere that was
immensely impressive. The hall had the portraits of
many liberal leaders and humanitarians on its walls,
and a number of paintings; and in connection
with the settlement which Jones established across
the street the institution came to be, as a reporter
wrote one day in his newspaper, the center of intelligence
in Toledo.</p>

<p>Well then, on that morning when first he called,
Jones said to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to come out and speak.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;On what subject?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one subject,&#8221; he said,&mdash;&#8220;life.&#8221; And
his face was radiant with a really beautiful smile,
warmed with his rich humor. I began to say that I
would prepare something, but he would not let me
finish my sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prepare!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Why prepare? Just
speak what&#8217;s in your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was always like that. Once, a good while
after, in one of his campaigns, he called me on the
telephone one evening just at dinner time, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to go to Ironville and speak to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was tired, and, as I dislike to confess, somewhat
reluctant,&mdash;I had always to battle so for a little
time to write,&mdash;so that I hesitated, asked questions,
told him, as usual, that I had no speech prepared.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know it is written,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that &#8216;in
that hour it shall be given you what ye shall say.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I could assure him that the prophecy had somewhat
failed in my case, and that what was given
me to say was not always worth listening to when
it was said; and then I inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of crowd will be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a good crowd!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what kind of people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of people?&#8221; he asked in a tone of
great and genuine surprise. &#8220;What kind of people?
Why, there&#8217;s only one kind of people&mdash;just people,
just folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went of course, and I went as well to Golden
Rule Park and to Golden Rule Hall, and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
never such a school for public speaking as that
crowded park afforded, with street cars grinding
and scraping by one side of it and children laughing
at their play on the swings and poles which
Jones had put there for them; or else standing below
the speaker and looking curiously up into his
face, and filling him with the fear of treading any
moment on their little fingers which, as they clung to
the edge, made a border all along the front of the
platform. And for a year or so after his death I
spoke there every Sunday: we were trying so hard to
keep his great work alive.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXI</h2>
</div>


<p>It was our interest in the disowned, the outcast,
the poor, and the criminal that drew us first together;
that and the fact that we are gradually
assuming the same attitude toward life. He was full
of Tolstoy at that time, and we could talk of the
great Russian, and I could introduce him to the
other great Russians. He was then a little past
fifty, and had just made the astounding discovery
that there was such a thing as literature in the
world: he had been so busy working all his life that
he had never had time to read, and the whole world
of letters burst upon his vision all suddenly, and the
glorious prospect fairly intoxicated him, so that he
stood like stout Cortez, though not so silent, upon
a peak in Darien.</p>

<p>He was reading Mazzini also, and William Morris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and Emerson, who expressed his philosophy fully, or
as fully as one man can express anything for another,
and it was not long before Jones discovered
an unusual facility for expressing himself, both with
his voice and with his pen. The letters he wrote
to the men in his shops&mdash;putting them in their pay-envelopes&mdash;are
models of simplicity and sincerity,
which show a genuine culture and have that beauty
which is the despair of conscious art.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> He had just
learned of Oscar Wilde&#8217;s &#8220;Ballad of Reading Gaol,&#8221;
and he committed it to memory, or got it into his
memory somehow, so that he would recite stanzas of
it to anyone. He read Burns, too, with avidity,
and I can see him now standing on the platform in
one of his meetings, snapping his fingers as he
recited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A fig for those by law protected!</div>
<div class="verse">Liberty&#8217;s a glorious feast!</div>
</div></div>

<p>But it was Walt Whitman whom he loved most,
and his copy of &#8220;Leaves of Grass&#8221; was underscored
in heavy lines with a red pencil until nearly every
striking passage in the whole work had become a
rubric. When anything struck him, he would have
to come and tell me of it; sometimes he would not
wait, but would call me up on the telephone and
read it to me. I remember that occasion when his
voice, over the wire, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to this [and he read]:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
&#8220;The snag-tooth&#8217;d hostler with red hair, redeeming sins past and to come,</div>
<div class="verse">Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his
brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then he laughed, and his chuckle died away on
the wire. That expressed him; that was exactly
what he would have done for a brother, exactly what
he did do for many a brother, since he regarded all
men as his brothers, and treated them as such if
they would let him. He was always going down to
the city prisons, or to the workhouses, and talking
to the poor devils there, quite as if he were one of
them, which indeed he felt he was, and as all of us
are, if we only knew it. And he was working all
the time to get them out of prison, and finally he
and I entered into a little compact by which he paid
the expenses incident to their trials&mdash;the fees for
stenographers and that sort of thing&mdash;if I would
look after their cases. Hard as the work was, and
sad as it was, and grievously as my law partners
complained of the time it took, and of its probable
effect on business (since no one wished to be known
as a criminal lawyer!), it did pay in the satisfaction
there was in doing a little to comfort and console&mdash;and,
what was so much more, to compel in one
city, at least, a discussion of the grounds and the
purpose of our institutions. For instance, if some
poor girl were arrested, and a jury trial were demanded
for her, and her case were given all the care
and attention it would have received had she been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
some wealthy person, the police, when they found
they could not convict, were apt to be a little more
careful of the liberties of individuals: they began to
have a little regard for human rights and for human
life.</p>

<p>We completely broke up the old practice of arresting
persons &#8220;on suspicion&#8221; and holding them at the
will and pleasure of the police without any charge
having been lodged against them; two or three trials
before juries, the members of which could very easily
be made to see, when it was pointed out to them
a few times in the course of a three days&#8217; trial, that
there is nothing more absurd than that policemen
should make criminals of people merely by suspecting
them, and sending them to prison on that
sole account, wrought a change. It annoyed the
officials of course, because it interfered with their
routine. It was no doubt exasperating to be compelled
to stay in court two or three days and try
some wretch according to the forms of law, just as
if he were somebody of importance and consequence
in the world, when they would so much rather have
been out at the ball-game, or fishing, or playing
pinochle in the guard-room at police headquarters
with the detail that had been relieved. Jones managed
to get himself fined for contempt one day, and
he immediately turned the incident to his own advantage
and made his point by drawing out his
check-book with a flourish, writing his check for
the amount of his fine, and declaring that this
proved his contention that the only crime our civilization
punishes is the crime of being poor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>But he was most in his element when the police
judge was absent, as he was now and then. In
that exigency the law gave Jones, as mayor, the
power to appoint the acting police judge; and
when Jones did not go down and sit as magistrate
himself, he appointed me; and we always found some
reason or other for letting all the culprits go. The
foundations of society were shaken of course, and
the editorials and sermons were heavy with all the
predictions of disaster; one might have supposed
that the whole wonderful and beautiful fabric of
civilization which man had been so long in rearing
was to fall forever into the awful abyss because a
few miserable outcasts had not been put in prison.
But nothing happened after all; the poor <i>mis&eacute;rables</i>
were back again in a few days, and made to resume
their hopeless rounds through the prison doors; but
the policemen of Toledo had their clubs taken away
from them, and they became human, and learned
to help people, and not to hurt them if they could
avoid it; and that police judge who once fined Jones
became in time one of the leaders in our city of the
new social movement that has marked the last decade
in America.</p>

<p>I learned to know a good many people in that
underworld, many of whom were professed criminals,
and there were some remarkable characters among
them. I learned that, just as Jones had said, they
were all people, just folks, and that they had so
much more good than bad in them, that if some
way could be devised whereby they might have a
little better opportunity to develop the good, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
was hope for all of them. Of course, in any effort
to help them,&mdash;and our efforts were not always
perhaps wholly wise,&mdash;we encountered that most
formidable and fundamental obstacle to prison reform,
the desire in the human breast for revenge,
the savage hatred which is perhaps some obscure
instinct of protection against the anti-social members
of society: it stands forever in the way of all
prison reform, and of ameliorations of the lot of
the poor. It is that which keeps the barbarity of
capital punishment alive in the world; it is that
which makes every prison in the land a hell, where
from time to time the most revolting atrocities are
practiced. Out of those experiences, out of the contemplation
of the misery, the pathos, the hopelessness
of the condition of those victims, I wrote &#8220;The
Turn of the Balance.&#8221; I was very careful of my
facts; I was purposely conservative, and, forgetting
the advice of Goethe, softened things down; as for
instance, where I had known of cases in which prisoners
had been hung up in the bull-rings for thirty
days,&mdash;being lowered to the floor each night of
course,&mdash;I put it down as eight days, and so on.
And the wise and virtuous judges and the preachers
and the respectable people all said it was untrue,
that such things could not be. Since then there
have been investigations of prisons in most of the
states, with revelations of conditions far worse than
any I tried to portray. And such things have gone
on, and are going on to-day; but nobody cares.</p>

</div>


<p>And yet somebody after all did care about all
those miserable souls who are immured in the terrible
prisons which society maintains as monuments
to the strange and implacable hatred in the breast
of mankind; perhaps, in the last chapter of these
vagrant memories, I allowed to creep into my utterance
some of the old bitterness which now and then
would taint our efforts, do what we might. And
that is not at all the note I would adopt, though
it used at times to be very difficult not to do so;
one cannot, day after day, beat against the old and
solid and impregnable wall of human institutions
without becoming sore and sick in one&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>And there is no institution which society so cherishes
as she does her penal institutions, and most
sacrosanct of these are the ax, the guillotine, the
garrote, the gibbet, the electric chair. We tried
at each session of the legislature to secure the passage
of a bill abolishing capital punishment, but
the good people, those who felt that they held in
their keeping the morals of the state, always opposed
it and defeated it. Beloved and sacred institution!
No wonder the ship-wrecked sailor, cast
upon an unknown shore, on looking up and beholding
a gallows, fell on his knees and said; &#8220;Thank
God, I&#8217;m in a Christian land!&#8221;</p>

<p>Travelers visit prisons and places of execution,
those historic spots where humanity made red blots
on its pathway in the notion that it was doing justice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and always they sigh and shake their heads,
beholding in those events only a supreme folly and
a supreme cruelty.</p>

<p>All the executions, all the imprisonments of the
past are seen to have been mistakes made by savages;
there is not one for which to-day a word is
uttered in excuse. All the Golgothas of the world
have become Calvaries, where men go in pity and in
tears in the hope that their regret may somehow
work a retroactive expiation of the guilt of their
cruel ancestors&mdash;and they rise from their knees and
go forth and acquiesce in brutalities that are to-day
different only in the slightest of degrees from
those they bemoan.</p>

<p>And so all the other executions of death sentences,
on subjects less distinguished, with no glimmer of
the halo of romance, no meed of martyrdom to illumine
them, are seen to have been huge and grotesque
mistakes of a humanity that at times gives
itself over to the elemental savage lust of the blood
of its fellows.</p>

<p>I do not say, of course, that there was any similarity
between the offenses of those whom Jones
and I were concerned about in those days and those
striking figures who illustrate the history of the
world and mark the slow spiral path of the progress
of mankind; these were the commonest of common
criminals, poor, mistaken, misshapen beings, somehow
marred in the making.</p>

<p>It was my lot to defend a number of those who
had committed murders, some of them murders so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
foul that there was nothing to say in their behalf.
All one could say was in behalf of those whom one
would save from committing another murder. But
when you have come to know even a murderer, when
day after day you have visited him in his cell, and
have talked with him, and have seen him laugh and
cry, and have had him tell you about his family, and
that amazing complexity which he calls his life, when
gradually you come to know him, no matter how
undeserving he may be in the abstract, he undergoes
a strange and subtle metamorphosis; slowly
and gradually, without your being aware, he ceases
to be a murderer, and becomes a human being, very
much like all those about you. Thus, there is no
such thing as a human being in the abstract; they
are all thoroughly and essentially concrete.</p>

<p>I have wandered far in these speculations, but I
hope I have not wandered too far to make it clear
that Jones&#8217;s point of view was always and invariably
the human point of view; he knew no such thing
as murderers, or even criminals, or &#8220;good&#8221; people,
or &#8220;bad&#8221; people, they were all to him men and, indeed,
brothers. And if society did not care about
them, except in its desire to make way with them,
Jones did care, and there were others who cared;
the poor cared, the working people cared,&mdash;though
they might themselves at times give way to the
same elemental social rage,&mdash;they always endorsed
Jones&#8217;s leniency whenever they had the opportunity.
They had this opportunity at the polls every two
years, and they never failed him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>They did not fail him even in that last campaign
of his, though every means known to man was tried
to win them away from their peculiar allegiance.
It was a strange campaign; I suppose there was
never another like it in America. As I think of it
there come back the recollections of those raw spring
nights; we held our municipal elections in the spring
in those days, that is, spring as we know it in the
region of the Great Lakes. It is not so much spring
as it is a final summing-up and recapitulation of
winter, a coda to a monstrous meteorological concerto
as doleful as the allegro lamentoso of Tschaikovsky&#8217;s
&#8220;Sixth Symphony.&#8221; There is nowhere in
the world, so far as I know, or care to know, such an
abominable manifestation of the meanness of nature;
it is meaner than the meanness of human nature,
entailing a constant struggle with winds, a perpetual
bending to gusts of snow that is rain, or a rain
that is hail, with an east wind that blows persistently
off Lake Erie for two months, with little stinging
barbs of ice on its breath&mdash;and then, suddenly, it is
summer without any gentle airs at all to introduce
its heat.</p>

<p>Jones was not very well that spring; and his
throaty ailment was the very one that should have
been spared such dreadful exposures as he was subjected
to in that campaign. It was in the days before
motor cars, and he and I drove about every
night from one meeting to another in a little buggy
he had, drawn by an old white mare named Molly,
whose shedding of her coat was the only vernal sign
to be detected anywhere. But Jones was so full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of humor that he laughed at nearly everything&mdash;even
his enemies, whom he never would call enemies.
I can see him now&mdash;climbing down out of the buggy,
carefully blanketing old Molly against the raw
blasts, then brushing the white hairs from his front
with his enormous hands, and running like a boy up
the stairway to the dim little hall in the Polish
quarter where the crowd had gathered. The men
set up a shout when they saw him, and he leaped
on the stage and, without waiting for the chairman
to introduce him,&mdash;he scorned every convention that
obtruded itself,&mdash;he leaned over the front of the
platform and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the Polish word for liberty?&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd of Poles, huddling about a stove in
the middle of the hall, their caps on, their pipes
going furiously, their bodies covered with the
strange garments they had brought with them across
the sea, shouted in reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wolno&#347;&#263;!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And Jones paused and listened, cocked his head,
wrinkled his brows, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that? Say it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they shouted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it again&mdash;once more!&#8221; he demanded. And
again they shouted it in a splendid chorus. And
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Golden Rule Jones, &#8220;I can&#8217;t pronounce
it, but it sounds good, and that is what we
are after in this campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that I have written it down, I have a feeling
that I have utterly failed to give an adequate sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
of the entire spontaneity and simplicity with which
this was done. It was, of course, tremendously effective
as a bit of campaigning, but only because it
was so wholly sincere. Five minutes later he was
hotly debating with a working man who had interrupted
him to accuse him of being unfair to union
labor in his shops, and there was no coddling, no
truckling, no effort to win or to please on his part,
though he would take boundlessly patient pains to
explain to anyone who really wanted to know anything
about him or his official acts.</p>

<p>He was natural, simple and unspoiled, as na&iuml;ve as
a child, and &#8220;except ye become as little children
ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.&#8221; He fully
realized that the kingdom of heaven is within one&#8217;s
self; he was not looking for it, or expecting it anywhere
outside of himself, certainly he was not expecting
it in a political campaign, or in the mere
process of being elected to an office. He regarded
his office, indeed, only as an opportunity to serve,
and he had been in that office long enough to have
lost any illusions he may ever have had concerning
it; one term will suffice to teach a man that lesson,
even though he seek the office again.</p>

<p>He was like an evangelist, in a way, and his meetings
were in the broad sense religious, though he
had long since left his church, not because its ministers
were always condemning him, but for the same
reasons that Tolstoy left his church. His evangel
was that of liberty. He had written a number of
little songs. One of them, set to the tune of an old
hymn he had heard in Wales as a boy, had a noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
effect when the crowd sang it. It was the <i>Gad im
Deimle</i>. His wife, who is an accomplished musician,
had transposed its minors into majors, and in its
strains, as they were sung by the men in his shops,&mdash;and
there was singing for you!&mdash;or by the people
in his political meetings, there was all the Welsh
love of music, all the Welsh love of liberty, and a
high and pure emotion in the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ever growing, swiftly flowing,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a mighty river</div>
<div class="verse">Sweeping on from shore to shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Love will rule this wide world o&#8217;er.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was his Welsh blood, this Celtic strain in him,
that accounted for much that was in his temperament,
his wit, his humor, his instinctive appreciation
of art, his contempt for artificial distinctions, his
love of liberty, his passionate democracy. Sitting
one evening not long ago in the visitor&#8217;s gallery of
the House of Commons I saw the great Welsh radical,
David Lloyd George, saw him enter and take his
seat on the government bench. And as I looked at
him I was impressed by his resemblance to someone I
had known; there was a strange, haunting likeness,
not in any physical characteristic, though there
was the same Welsh ruddiness, and the hair was
something like&mdash;but when Mr. Lloyd George turned
and whispered to the prime minister and smiled I
started, and said to myself: &#8220;It is Jones!&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>There was something pathetic in that last campaign,
the pathos, perhaps, of the last phase. The
long years of opposition had begun to tell: there was
a strong determination to defeat him. He had not
wished to stand again for the office, but, after the
Toledo custom, there had been presented to him an
informal petition, signed by several thousand citizens,
asking him to do so, and he had consented.
But when he wrote a statement setting forth his position&mdash;it
was a document with the strong flavor of his
personality in it&mdash;the newspapers refused to publish
it; some of them would not publish it even as advertising,
and he opened his campaign on the post-office
corner, standing bare-headed in the March wind, his
son Paul blowing a saxophone to attract a crowd.
Many of his old supporters were falling away; it
seemed for a time that he alone would have to make
the campaign without any to speak for him on the
stump; far otherwise than in that second campaign,
when, after having been counted out in the Republican
convention, he had run for the first time independently,
a &#8220;Man Without a Party,&#8221; as he called
himself; and thousands, themselves outraged by the
treatment his own party had accorded him, in the
spirit of fair play had rallied to his standard.</p>

<p>But now things had changed, and an incident
which occurred at the beginning of this campaign
was significant of the feeling toward him, though in
all kindness it most not be told in detail. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
was a prominent man in town who had publicly reviled
him and criticized him and persecuted him, who
had done that which cut him more deeply than all
else, that is, he had impugned his motives and questioned
his sincerity. In some human hunger for understanding,
I suppose, Jones went to this man
with his written statement of his position and asked
him to read it, merely to read it. The fellow&#8217;s answer
was to snatch the paper from Jones&#8217;s hand
and tear it up in his face. It is easy to imagine
what a man ordinarily would do in the face of such
an amazing insult; surely, if ever, the time had come
for the &#8220;shotgun and the club.&#8221; Mayor Jones was
large and powerful, he had been reared in the oil
fields, where blows are quick as tempers; he was athletic,
always in training, for he took constant physical
exercise (one of the counts against him, indeed,
was that he slept out of doors on the roof of his
back porch, a bit of radicalism in those days, grown
perfectly orthodox in these progressive times), and
he was a Celt, naturally quick to resent insult, of
a temperament prompt to take fire. But he turned
away from the fellow, without a word.</p>

<p>He came to my office immediately afterward, and
I saw that he was trying hard to master some unusual
emotion. I shall never forget him as he sat
there, telling me of his experience. After a little
while his face broke into that beautiful smile of
his, more beautiful than I had ever seen it, and he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve won the greatest victory of my life;
I have won at last a victory over myself, over my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
own nature. I have done what it has always been
hardest for me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He sat in silence for a moment, and then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, it has always seemed to me that the
most remarkable thing that was ever said of Jesus
was that when he was reviled, he reviled not again.
It is the hardest thing in the world to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The struggle over the renewal of the franchise
grants to the street railway company had already
begun, and the council had attempted to grant it the
franchise it wished, renewing its privileges for another
twenty-five years. When Mayor Jones vetoed
the bill, the council prepared to pass it over his
veto, and would have done so that Monday night
had it not been for two men&mdash;Mayor Jones and Mr.
Negley D. Cochran, the editor of the <i>News-Bee</i>,
a newspaper which has always taken the democratic
viewpoint of public questions. Mr. Cochran, with
his brilliant gift in the writing of editorials, had
called out the whole populace, almost, to attend the
meeting of the council and to protest. The demonstration
was so far effective that the council was
too frightened to pass the street railway ordinance.
The attorney for the street railway company was
there, and when there was a lull in the noise, he
sneered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, Mr. Mayor, that this is an example
of government under the Golden Rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Jones in a flash, &#8220;it is an example
of government under the rule of gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unless it were because of his interference with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
nefarious privileges of a few, one can see no reason
why the press and pulpit should have opposed him.
What had he done? He had only preached that
the fundamental doctrine of Christianity was sound,
and, as much as a man may in so complex a civilization,
he had tried to practice it. He had taught
kindness and tolerance, and pity and mercy; he had
visited the sick, and gone to those that were in
prison; he had said that all men are free and equal,
that they have been endowed by their Creator with
certain inalienable rights. He had said that it is
wrong to kill people, even in the electric chair, that
it is wrong to take from the poor, without giving
them in return. He had not said these things in
anger, or in bitterness; he had never been personal,
he had always been explicit in saying that he, as a
part of society, was equally to blame with all the
rest for social wrongs. The only textbooks he ever
used in his campaigns were the New Testament, the
Declaration of Independence, and, of course, his beloved
Walt Whitman. And yet the pulpits rang
every Sunday with denunciations of him, and the
newspapers opposed him. Why was it, because a
man endorsed these old doctrines upon which society
claims to rest, that society should denounce
him?</p>

<p>I think it was because he was so utterly and entirely
sincere, and because he believed these things,
and tried to put them into practice in his life, and
wished them to be more fully incorporated in the
life of society. Society will forgive anything in a
man, except sincerity. If he be sincere in charity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
in pity, in mercy, in sympathy for the outcast, the
despised, the imprisoned, all that vast horde of the
denied and proscribed, still less will it forgive him,
for it knows instinctively that the privileges men
have or seek could not exist in a system where
these principles were admitted as vital, inspiring
force.</p>

<p>There was nothing, of course, for one who believed
in the American doctrines to do but to support
such a man, and when he appeared to be so utterly
without supporters it seemed to be one&#8217;s duty more
than ever, though I own to having shrunk from such
unconventional methods as Jones employed. That
meeting at the post-office corner, for instance; someone
might laugh, and in the great American self-consciousness
and fear of the ridiculous, what was
one to do? The opposition, that is, the two old
parties, the Republican and Democratic, had nominated
excellent men against Jones; the Republican
nominee, indeed, Mr. John W. Dowd, was a man
to whom I had gone to school, an old and very dear
friend of our family, a charming gentleman of cultivated
tastes. It was not easy to be in the attitude
of opposing him, but my duty seemed clear, and I
went into the campaign with Jones, and we spoke
together every night.</p>

<p>It was a campaign in which were discussed most
of the fundamental problems of social life. A
stranger, coming to Toledo at that time, might have
thought us a most unsophisticated people, for there
were speculations about the right of society to inflict
punishment, the basis of property, and a rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
searching inquiry into the subject of representative
government. This was involved in the dispute as to
the propriety of political machines, for the Republicans
by that time had a party organization so strong
that it was easily denominated a machine; it was so
strong that it controlled every branch of the city
government except the executive; it never could defeat
Jones. There was a good deal said, too, about
the enforcement of law, a subject which has its fascination
for the people of my town.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p>Besides these interesting topics there was the subject
of municipal home rule. This had already become
vital in Toledo because, a year or so before,
the Republican party organization through its influence
in the state, without having to strain its
powers of persuasion, had induced the legislature
to pass a special law which deprived the Mayor of
Toledo of his control of the police force and vested
the government of that body in a commission appointed
by the governor of the state.</p>

<p>It had been, of course, a direct offense to Jones,
and it was intended to take from him the last of his
powers. He had been greatly roused by it; the
morning after the law had been enacted he had
appeared at my house before breakfast to discuss
this latest assault upon liberty. The law was an
exact replica of a law that had been passed for Cincinnati
many years before, and that law had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
sustained by the Supreme Court in a decision which
had made it the leading case on that subject of constitutional
law for a whole generation. Time and
again it had been attacked and always it had been
sustained; to contest the constitutionality of this
new act seemed the veriest folly.</p>

<p>But Jones was determined to resist; like some
stout burgomaster of an old free city of Germany
he determined to stand out against the city&#8217;s overlords
from the rural districts, and he insisted on my
representing him in the litigation which his resistance
would certainly provoke. I had no hope of
winning, and told him so; I explained the precedent
in the Cincinnati case, and that only made him more
determined; if there was one thing more than another
for which he had a supreme and sovereign
contempt it was a legal precedent. My brethren at
the bar all laughed at me, as I knew they would; but
I went to work, and after a few days&#8217; investigation
became convinced that the doctrine laid down in
that leading case was not at all sound.</p>

<p>When I came to this conviction, I induced Jones
to retain additional counsel, one of the most brilliant
lawyers at our bar, Mr. Clarence Brown, a man
who, in addition to his knowledge of the law, could
bring to the forum a charming personality, a wit and
an eloquence that were irresistible. He, too, set to
work, and in a few days he was convinced, as I, that
the precedent should be overthrown. Jones refused
to turn over the command of the police to the new
commissioners whom the governor appointed; they
applied to the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
we tried the case, and we won, overthrowing
not only the doctrine at the Cincinnati case, but the
whole fabric of municipal legislation in the state, so
that a special session of the legislature was necessary
to enact new codes for the government of the
cities.</p>

<p>Our satisfaction and our pride in our legal
achievement was somewhat modified by the fact that
the application of the same rule to conditions in
our sister city of Cleveland had the effect, in certain
cases then pending, of pulling down the work
which another great mayor, Tom L. Johnson, was
then doing in that city. It was even said that the
Supreme Court had been influenced by the desire of
Mark Hanna, Tom Johnson&#8217;s ancient enemy in
Cleveland, to see his old rival defeated. Some were
unkind enough to say that Mark Hanna&#8217;s influence
was more powerful with the court, as at that time
constituted, than was the logic of the attorneys
who were representing Golden Rule Jones.</p>

<p>But however that may have been, the decision in
that case had ultimate far-reaching effects in improving
the conditions in Ohio cities, and was the
beginning of a conflict that did not end until they
were free and autonomous. In my own case it was
the beginning of a study of municipal government
that has grown more fascinating as the years have
fled, a study that has led me to see, or to think that
I see, the large hope of our democracy in the cities of
America.</p>

<p>I regard it as Jones&#8217;s supreme contribution to
the thought of his time that, by the mere force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
his own original character and personality, he compelled
a discussion of fundamental principles of government.
Toledo to-day is a community which has
a wider acquaintance with all the abstract principles
of social relations than any other city in the land,
or in the world, since, when one ventures into generalities,
one might as well make them as sweeping
as one can.</p>

<p>Jones&#8217;s other great contribution to the science of
municipal government was that of non-partizanship
in local affairs. That is the way he used to express
it; what he meant was that the issues of national
politics must not be permitted to obtrude themselves
into municipal campaigns, and that what divisions
there are should be confined to local issues. There
is, of course, in our cities, as in our land or any
land, only one issue, that which is presented by the
conflict of the aristocratic, or plutocratic, spirit and
the spirit of democracy.</p>

<p>Jones used to herald himself as &#8220;a Man Without
a Party,&#8221; but he was a great democrat, the most
fundamental I ever knew or imagined; he summed
up in himself, as no other figure of our time since
Lincoln, all that the democratic spirit is and hopes
to be. Perhaps in this characterization I seem to
behold his figure larger than it was in relation to the
whole mass, but while his work may appear at first
glance local, it was really general and universal. No
one can estimate the peculiar and lively force of such
a personality; certainly no one can presume to limit
his influence, for such a spirit is illimitable and
irresistible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He was elected in that last campaign for the
fourth time, but he did not live very long. He had
never, it seemed to me, been quite the same after the
day when he had that experience of insult which
he did not resent. &#8220;Draw the sting,&#8221; he used to
counsel us when, in our campaign harangues, we became
bitter, or sarcastic, or merely smart. He had
supreme reliance on the simple truth, on the power
of reasonableness. He never reviled again; he never
sought to even scores. When he died the only
wounds he left in human hearts were because he was
no more. They understood him at last, those who
had scoffed and sneered and abused and vilified, and
I, who had had the immense privilege of his friendship,
and thought I knew him,&mdash;when I stood that
July afternoon, on the veranda of his home, beside
his bier to speak at his funeral, and looked out over
the thousands who were gathered on the wide lawn
before his home,&mdash;I realized that I, too, had not
wholly understood him.</p>

<p>I know not how many thousands were there; they
were standing on the lawns in a mass that extended
across the street and into the yards on the farther
side. Down to the corner, and into the side streets,
they were packed, and they stood in long lines all the
way out to the cemetery. In that crowd there were
all sorts of that one sort he knew as humanity without
distinction,&mdash;judges, and women of prominence
and women whom he alone would have included in
humanity, there were thieves, and prize-fighters,&mdash;and
they all stood there with the tears streaming
down their faces.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>There is no monument to Golden Rule Jones in
Toledo; and since St. Gaudens is gone I know of no
one who could conceive him in marble or in bronze.
There is not a public building which he erected, no
reminder of him which the eye can see or the hands
touch. But his name is spoken here a thousand
times a day, and always with the reverence that
marks the passage of a great man upon the earth.
And I am sure that his influence did not end here.
Did not a letter come from Yasnaya Polyana in
the handwriting of the great Tolstoy, who somehow
had heard of this noble and simple soul who was, in
his own way, trying the same experiment of life
which the great Russian was making?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>


<p>In the beginning, of course, it was inevitable that
Jones should have been called a Socialist. I suppose
he did not care much himself, but the Socialists
cared, and promptly disowned him, and were at one
with the capitalists in their hatred and abuse of
him. He shared, no doubt, the Socialists&#8217; great
dream of an ordered society, though he would not
have ordered it by any kind of force or compulsion,
but in that spirit which they sneer at as mere sentimentalism.
He was patient with them; he saw their
point of view; he had, indeed, the immense advantage
of being in advance of them in his development.
He saw Socialism not, as most see it, from the hither
side, but from the farther side, as one who has passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
through it; he was like a man who having left the
dusty highway and entered a wood which he thinks
his journey&#8217;s end, suddenly emerges and from a hill
beholds the illimitable prospect that lies beyond. Of
course he could never endure anything so doctrinaire
as Socialism, in the form in which he was accustomed
to see it exemplified in the Socialists about
him. He could not endure their orthodoxy, any more
than he could endure the orthodoxy they were contending
against. Their sectarianism was to him
quite as impossible as that sectarianism he had known
in other fields. Their bigotry was as bad as any. He
saw no good to come from a substitution of their
tyranny for any other of the many old tyrannies in
the world. And naturally to one of his spirit the
class hatred they were always inciting under the
name of class consciousness was as abhorrent to him
as all hatred was.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Socialists, with their passion for
generalization, for labeling and pigeonholing everything
in the universe, said he was an anarchist. The
more charitable of them, wishing to sterilize the term
and rid it of its sinister implication, but still insistently
scientific, said he was a &#8220;philosophic&#8221; anarchist.
That is a term too vague to use, though in
one sense, I suppose, all good men are anarchists,
in that they would live their lives as well without
laws as with them. Jones himself would have scorned
those classifications as readily as he would had anyone
said he was a duke or an earl. &#8220;No title is
higher than Man,&#8221; he wrote once in a little campaign
song. And he was that&mdash;a Man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>He would not join any society or, as he said,
&#8220;belong&#8221; to anything. I have thought so often of
what he said to a book agent one day. We were
just on the point of leaving the Mayor&#8217;s office for
luncheon, and the individual who wishes &#8220;just a
minute&#8221; was inevitably there, blocking the way out
of the office. He was indubitably a book agent; anyone
who has a rudimentary knowledge of human nature
can identify them at once, but this one had as
his insinuating disguise some position as a representative
of a Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association,
and he was there to confer on the Mayor the
honor of a membership in that society.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what books am I required to buy?&#8221; asked
Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the agent said, &#8220;you are not required
to buy any books, but, of course, a member of
the association would naturally want Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s
complete works.&#8221; Jones&#8217;s eyes were twinkling;
&#8220;Mr.&#8221; Jefferson amused him immensely, of
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very popular,&#8221; the man went on, &#8220;many
persons are buying them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t find the ideas in them very popular; certainly
those in Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s greatest work are
not popular; no one wants to see them adopted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To which one of his works do you refer?&#8221; asked
the agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the one that is best known,&#8221; said Jones, &#8220;its
title is &#8216;The Declaration of Independence.&#8217; I already
have a copy of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor fellow was conscious that his enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
was not going very well, but he said, with a flourish
of magnanimity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s immaterial to me whether you take
the books or not, but of course you will wish to
belong to the association?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I already belong to the association in which
Mr. Jefferson was chiefly interested,&#8221; said Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, may I ask?&#8221; said the agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The United States of America,&#8221; said Jones,
&#8220;and as I am a member of that, I see no reason why
I should join anything smaller.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he laughed, and if there had been any
uneasiness because of his gentle guying, it disappeared
when he laid his hand on the agent&#8217;s shoulder
and looked into his eyes in that spirit of friendliness
which enveloped him like an aureole.</p>

<p>He had a conception of unity that was far beyond
his contemporaries, a conception that will be
beyond humanity for many years. It was that conception
which enabled him to see through the vast
superstition of war, and the superstition of partizanship,
and all the other foolish credulities that
have misled the people in all times.</p>

<p>One evening, it was just at dark, we were leaving
the mayor&#8217;s office to walk home&mdash;we walked home
together nearly every evening&mdash;and in the dusk a
tramp, a negro, came up and asked him for the price
of a night&#8217;s lodging. The Mayor fumbled in his
pockets, but he had no small change, he had only a
five-dollar bill, but he gave this to the tramp and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go get it changed, and bring it back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The tramp took it and disappeared, and we
waited. Jones talked on about other things, but I
was interested in the tramp; my expectation of his
return was far more uncertain than Jones&#8217;s. But
after a while the tramp did come back, and he poured
out into the Mayor&#8217;s hand the change in silver coin.
The Mayor complained humanly of the heavy
silver which the Secretary of the Treasury always
sends out to us, so that the new one-dollar bills
may go to New York City, and tumbled the money
into his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;But ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to count it?&#8221; asked the negro
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you count it?&#8221; asked Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, suh, I counted it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it all there, wasn&#8217;t it all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, there&#8217;s no need for me to count it,
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The negro looked in wide white-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you take out what you wanted?&#8221; asked the
Mayor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, suh, I didn&#8217;t take any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, then,&#8221; said Jones, and he gave the man a
half-dollar and went on.</p>

<p>There was no possible ostentation in this; it was
perfectly natural; he was doing such things every
hour of the day.</p>

<p>He had no need to stop there, in the dark, to impress
me, his friend and intimate. I do him wrong
even to stoop to explain so much. But I wonder how
much good his confidence did that wandering outcast?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
How much good did it do to me? By the
operation of the same law which brought that vagrant
back to Jones&#8217;s side with all the money, I
with my distrust, might have been treated far differently.</p>

<p>Or so, at least, it seems to me, and I tell this
incident as one which proves the reverence Jones
had for the great natural law of love. For the chief
count in the indictment respectability brought
against him was that he had no reverence for law.
To see and hear them when they said this, one would
have supposed that a council or legislature had never
been corrupted in the land. It used to amuse Jones
to reflect that his literal acceptance of the fundamental
principle of Christianity should have been
such a novel and unprecedented thing that it instantly
marked him out from all the other Christians
and made him famous in Christendom.</p>

</div>


<p>I say famous, and perhaps I mean only notorious,
for in the beginning many of his townsmen meant
it as a reflection, and not a tribute. Some of them
said it was but an advertising dodge, a bit of demagogism,
but as Jones applied the rule to everybody,
other explanations had soon to be adopted, and
after he had employed it about the City Hall for
two years the situation became so desperate that
something had to be done. Controversy was provoked,
and for almost a decade, Toledo presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the unique spectacle of a modern city in which this
principle was discussed as though it were something
newly discovered. Some seemed to think that Jones
had invented it; they said it was absurd, that it
really would not work. Of course most regarded it,
as most now regard the Golden Rule, as a pretty
sentiment merely, something for the children in Sunday-school.
It is considered, of course, as any
sophisticated person knows, as altogether impractical,
and even silly and absurd.</p>

<p>To be sure, the clergymen were under some sort
of professional necessity of treating it seriously, and
they used to prepare profound papers, arranged in
heads and subheads, with titles and subtitles, and
after all the usual ostentatious preliminary examination
of the grounds and the authorities, and with
the appearance of academic fairness, in discussions
that were formal, exact, redolent of the oil, bearing
the hallmark of the schools, they would show that
Jesus meant there were only certain exigencies in
which, and certain persons to whom, this rule was
to be applied. It was all very learned and impressive,
but one was apt to develop a disturbing doubt
as to whether one was of those to whom it was
to be applied. It was certainly not to be applied to
criminals, or perhaps even to politicians. It was not
to be applied to poor people, or to the working
people, unless they were in Sunday-school as conscious
inferiors, in devout and penitent attitudes.
And as these people were so seldom in church or
Sunday-school, and as those who were there apparently
needed no such consideration, these discourses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
left one rather uncertain as to what to do with the
Golden Rule.</p>

<p>All men of course believe in the Golden Rule, or
say they do, but they believe in it only &#8220;up to a
certain point,&#8221; and with each individual this point
differs; the moment in which to abandon the Rule
and take to &#8220;the shotgun and the club&#8221; comes to
some soon, to others late, and to some oftener than
others; but to most, if not to all of us, it inevitably
arrives. That is why, no doubt, the world is no
farther along in the solution of the many distressing
problems it has on its mind.</p>

<p>According to the standards of conduct and of
&#8220;honor&#8221; inherited from the feudal ages, while personal
violence may be conceded to be illegal, one is,
nevertheless, still generally taught that it is wrong
and unmanly not to resent an insult or an injury, by
violence, if necessary,&mdash;fighting and killing, by individuals,
states and nations, are thought to be not
only honorable and worthy, but, in many cases, indispensable.
Society has an obsession similar to that
strange superstition of the feud, which affects the
Kentucky mountaineers. Generally we are less
afraid to fight than we are not to fight. Our system
is based on force, our faith is placed in force, so that
nearly all of the proposals of reform, for the correction
of abuses, involve the use of violence in some
form. We have erected a huge idol in the figure of
the beadle, who, assisted by the constable, is to make
society over, to make men &#8220;good.&#8221; Jones came upon
the scene in America at a time when there was undoubtedly
a new and really splendid impetus toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
a better and higher conception of life and conduct,
both in public and private. Yet even then no other
thought seemed to possess the public mind than that
someone should be put in prison and made to suffer.</p>

<p>Men did not and do not see what Jones saw so
much more clearly than any other reformer of his
time, namely that, above all the laws men make with
their political machines in their legislatures, there
is a higher law, and that the Golden Rule is a rule
of conduct deduced from that law. He saw that
men, whether they knew it or not, liked it or not, or
were conscious of it or not, had in all times been
living, and must forever go on living, under the principle
on which the Golden Rule is based. That is,
Jones saw that this great law had always existed
in the universe, just as the law of gravitation existed
before Newton discovered it. It is inherent in the
very constitution of things, as one of that body of
laws which govern the universe and always act and
react equally among men. And Jones felt that men
should for their comfort, if for no higher motive,
respect this law and get the best out of life by observing
it; and that it should be the business of men
through their governments to seek out this law and
the rules that might scientifically be deduced from
it, instead of putting their faith in their own contrivances
of statutes, resolutions, orders, and decrees,
and, when these would not work, trying to make them
effective through grand juries and petit juries, and
all the hideous machinery of jails and prisons, and
scaffolds and electric chairs. And because he had no
superstitious reverence for policemen or their clubs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
or for soldiers and their bayonets and machine guns,
they said he had no reverence for law.</p>

<p>He had, of course, been to the legislature; he
had seen the midnight sessions there, when statutes
were enacted amid scenes of drunken riot and confusion,
and he saw no reason why he should have reverence
for the acts of these men. Perhaps he was
wrong; I am only trying to tell how it appeared to
him. He was not a lawyer, but he knew what many
lawyers have never learned, that there is sometimes
a vast difference between a statute and a law. He
saw that not all statutes are laws; that they are laws
only when, by accident or design, they are in conformity
with those rules by which the universe is
governed, whether in the physical or the spiritual
world, and these laws, eternal and immutable, are
invariable, self-executing, instant in operation, without
judges to declare them, or executives to enforce
them, or courts to say whether they are unconstitutional
or not.</p>

<p>He saw that the law on which the Golden Rule is
founded, the law of moral action and reaction, is the
one most generally ignored. Its principle he felt to
be always at work, so that men lived by it whether
they wished to or not, whether they knew it or not.
According to this law, hate breeds hate and love produces
love in return; and all force begets resistance,
and the result is the general disorder and anarchy
in which we live so much of the time.</p>

<p>It may be that in this view of life some dangerous
apothegms are involved; as we grow older we grow
conservative, and conservatism is a kind of cynicism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
a kind of fear, the trembling distrust of age. But I
know that in the life concept to which Jones came
in his study of this principle, every act of his life,
no matter how trifling and insignificant it may have
seemed, suddenly took on a vast and vital significance;
so that the hasty glance, the unkind word,
the very spirit in which a thing is said or done, were
seen to have an effect which may reach farther than
the imagination can go, an effect not only on one&#8217;s
own life and character, but on the lives and characters
of all those about him. He was always human;
I say that to prevent any impression that he was
solemn or priggish; he deliberately took up smoking,
for instance, toward the end of his days, because, he
said with a chuckle, one must have some vices. And
sometimes when the Golden Rule seemed not to
&#8220;work,&#8221; he would truly say it was only because he
didn&#8217;t know how to work it. And he used to quote
Walt Whitman:</p>

<p>I first saw Tom Johnson in the early nineties in
Cleveland, at a Democratic state convention, where
one naturally might have expected to see him. I
had gone to Cleveland to report the convention for
the Chicago <i>Herald</i>, and since it was summer, and
summer in Ohio, it was a pleasant thing to be back
again among the Democrats of my own state, many
of whom I had known, some of whom I honored.
And that morning&mdash;I think it was the morning
after some frenzied members of the Hamilton county
delegation had been shooting at one another in
Banks Street in an effort to settle certain of those
differences in the science of statecraft which then
were apt, as they are now, to trouble the counsels
of the Cincinnati politicians&mdash;I was walking along
Superior Street when I heard a band playing the
sweet and somehow pathetic strains of &#8220;Home Again,
Home Again.&#8221; There were other bands playing that
morning, but the prevailing tune was &#8220;The Campbells
are Coming&#8221;; for we might as well have been
Scotchmen at the siege of Lucknow in Ohio during
those years that James E. Campbell was Governor
of our state. We grew to love the tune and we grew
to love him, he was so brilliant and human and affable;
but he could not pose very well in a frock coat,
and after he had been renominated at that very
convention, McKinley defeated him for governor.</p>

<p>But as I was saying, it was not &#8220;The Campbells
are Coming&#8221; which the band was playing that morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
but &#8220;Home Again,&#8221; and along the wide street,
with an intimate sense of proprietorship that excluded
strangers from this particular demonstration,
people were saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Tom Johnson, home from Europe!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was his own employees who had gone forth to
meet him, the men who worked for him in the street
railway system he owned in Cleveland in those days,
and I thought it rather a pretty compliment that a
man&#8217;s employees should like him so well that they
would turn out to welcome him with a band when he
came home from his holiday abroad. I could understand
their feeling when an hour later I saw Tom
Johnson in the Hollenden Hotel, the center of a
group of political friends; he seemed as glad as any
of them to be back among so many Democrats. He
still had his youth, and there was in his manner a
peculiar, subtle charm, a gift with which the gods
are rather stingy among the sons of men. I can see
him now, his curly hair moist with the heat of the
summer day, his profile, clear enough for a Greek
coin, and the smile that never failed him, or failed
a situation, to the end. He was, I think, in Congress
in those days of which I am writing, or if he was
not, he went to Congress soon after from one of the
Cleveland districts. And while he was there he wrote
a remarkable letter in response to a communication
he had received from some girls who worked in a
cloak factory in Cleveland, asking him to vote
against the Wilson tariff bill when it was amended
by adding a specific duty to the <i>ad valorem</i> duty on
women&#8217;s cloaks. The girls, of course, poor things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
had not written the communication; it was written
by the editor of a protectionist newspaper in Cleveland,
and the response which Johnson sent was one
of the simplest and clearest expositions of the evils
of protection I ever read. I had read it when it was
published, and had been delighted, but it was not
for a dozen years that I was able to tell Johnson
of my delight, and then one day as he and Dr.
Frederic C. Howe and I were at luncheon I spoke
of the letter. He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a great letter, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed it was,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wonderful letter,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;You know, it
completely shut them up around here. The editor of
that paper tried for weeks to reply to it, and then
he gave it up, and he told me privately some time
afterward that he was sure the theory of protection
was right, but that it wouldn&#8217;t work on women&#8217;s
cloaks. Yes, it was a great letter.&#8221; And then with
a sigh, he added: &#8220;I wish I could have written such
a letter. Henry George worked on that letter for
days and nights before we got it to suit us; I&#8217;d
think and think, and he&#8217;d write and write, and then
tear up what he had written, but finally we got it
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry George was the great influence in his life,
as he has been the influence in the lives of so many
in this world. Johnson had been a plutocrat; he had
made, or to use a distinction Golden Rule Jones used
to insist upon, he had &#8220;gathered,&#8221; by the time he was
thirty, an immense fortune, through legal privileges.
Johnson&#8217;s privileges had been tariffs on steel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
street railway franchises in several cities, and thus
early in life he was almost ready for that most
squalid of all poverty, mere possession. And then
suddenly he had a marvelous experience, one that
comes to few men; he caught a vision of a new social
order.</p>

<p>He was on a railway train going from Indianapolis
to New York, and the news agent on the train
importuned him to buy a novel. Johnson waved
him aside&mdash;I can imagine with what imperious impatience.
But this agent was not to be waved aside;
he persisted after the manner of his kind; he had
that weird occult power by which the book agent
weaves his spell and paralyses the will, even such a
superior will as Tom Johnson&#8217;s, and the agent sold
to him, not a novel, but Henry George&#8217;s &#8220;Social
Problems.&#8221; He was not given to reading; he read
only for information, and even then he usually had
someone else read to him. Once during his last illness
he asked me what I was reading, and I told him
Ferrero&#8217;s &#8220;Rome,&#8221; and tried to give him some notion
of Ferrero&#8217;s description of the political machine
which C&aelig;sar and Pompey had organized, and of the
private fire department of Crassus, and he said:
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have Newton read it to me.&#8221; He used to
wonder sometimes half wistfully, as though he were
missing some good in life, how it was that I loved
poetry so, and it was somehow consoling when Mr.
Richard McGhee, that fine Irish member of Parliament,
told me one night in the House of Commons
that when Johnson made that last journey to England
he had read Burns to him, and that Johnson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
had loved and even recited certain passages from
them. Well then, Johnson bought his book, and idly
turning the pages began to read, became interested,
finally enthralled, and read on and on. Later he
bought &#8220;Progress and Poverty,&#8221; and as he read that
wonderful book, as there dawned upon his consciousness
the awful realization that notwithstanding all
the amazing progress mankind has made in the
world, poverty has kept even pace with it, stalking
ever at its side, that with all of man&#8217;s inventions,
labor-saving devices, and all that, there has been no
such amelioration of the human lot, no such improvement
in society as should have come from so much
effort and achievement, he had a spiritual awakening,
experienced within him something that was veritably,
as the Methodists would say, a &#8220;conversion.&#8221;
There was an instant revolution in his nature, or in
his purpose; he turned to confront life in an entirely
new attitude, and he began to have that which so
many, rich and poor, utterly lack, so many to whom
existence is but a meaningless confusion of the
senses, a life concept. And with this new concept
there came a new ideal.</p>

<p>He at once sought out Henry George, the two
became fast friends, and the friendship lasted until
George&#8217;s dramatic death in the midst of his campaign
for the mayoralty of New York. George used
to do much of his work at the Johnson home in
Cleveland&mdash;and used to forget to fasten his collar
when he was called from that spell of concentration
over his desk to the dinner table. The Johnsons
were aristocrats from Kentucky, descended from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
long line of southern ancestors. And yet Tom
Johnson was a Democrat, from conviction and principle.
In fact it seems almost as though the cause
of democracy would never have got on at all if
now and then it had not had aristocrats to lead it,
as ever it has had, from the times of the Gracchi to
those of the Mirabeaus and the Lafayettes and the
Jeffersons.</p>

<p>Tom Johnson made an instant impression when he
went into politics, and he went in on the explicit
advice of Henry George. When he arose in the
House of Representatives at Washington to make his
first speech, no one paid the least attention. It is, I
suppose, the most difficult place in the world to
speak, not so much because of the audience, but because
of the arrangement; that scattered expanse
of desks is not conducive to dramatic effect, or to
any focusing of interest. The British Parliament
is the only one in the world that is seated properly;
there the old form of the lists is maintained, opponents
meet literally face to face across that narrow
chamber. But when Johnson arose at Washington,
there were those scattered desks, and the members&mdash;lolling
at their desks, writing letters, reading newspapers,
clapping their hands for pages, gossiping,
sauntering about, arising and going out, giving no
heed whatever. But Tom Johnson had not spoken
many words before Tom Reed, then the leader on the
Republican side, suddenly looked up, listened, put
his hand behind his ear, and leaning forward intently
said: &#8220;Sh!&#8221; and thus brought his followers
to attention before the new and strong personality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
whose power he had so instantly recognized.</p>

<p>It was a power that was felt in that House. They
tried to shelve him; they put him on the committee
for the District of Columbia, and no shelf could
have pleased him more, or been better suited to his
peculiar genius, for it gave him a city to deal with.
The very first thing he did was to investigate the
revenues of the District, and he made a report on
the subject, based on the theories underlying the
proposition of the single tax. He tried to have the
single tax adopted for the District, and while he
failed in that design his report is a classic on the
whole subject of municipal taxation, even if, like
most classics, it is little read. He made some splendid
speeches, too, on the tariff, and by a clever device,
under the rule giving members leave to print
what no one is willing to hear, he contrived, with
the help of several colleagues, to distribute over the
land more than a million copies of Henry George&#8217;s
&#8220;Protection and Free Trade,&#8221; giving that work a
larger circulation than all the six best sellers among
the romantic novels.</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiar weaknesses of our political
system that our strongest men cannot be kept
very long in Congress, and it was Johnson&#8217;s fate to
be defeated after his second term, but he then entered
a field of political activity which was not only thoroughly
congenial to him, but one in which for the
present the struggle for democracy must be carried
on. That field is the field of municipal politics which
he entered just at the time of the awakening which
marked the first decade of the new century.</p>

<p>When I think of the beginning of that period my
thought goes back to an afternoon in New York,
when, sitting in the editorial rooms of <i>McClure&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, Lincoln Steffens said to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do a series of articles for the magazine
on municipal government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you know about municipal government?&#8221;
I asked in the tone a man may adopt with
his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going
to write about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We smiled in the pleasure we both had in his fun,
but we did not talk long about municipal government
as we were to do in the succeeding years; we had
more interesting subjects to discuss just then.</p>

<p>I had been on a holiday to New England with my
friend John D. Barry, and had just come from
Maine where I had spent a week at Kittery Point,
in the delight of long summer afternoons in the company
of Mr. William Dean Howells, whom, indeed, in
my vast admiration, and I might say, my reverence
for him, I had gone there to see. He had introduced
me to Mark Twain, and I had come away with feelings
that were no less in intensity I am sure than
those with which Moses came down out of Mount
Horeb. And Steffens and I celebrated them and
their writings and that quality of right-mindedness
they both got into their writings, and we had our
joy in their perfect Americanism. The word had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
definite meaning for us; it occurred to us at that
time because of some tremendous though unavailing
blows which Mark Twain had delivered against our
government&#8217;s policy in the Philippines, the time
falling in that era of khaki imperialism which opened
in this land with the Spanish war and too much
reading of Kipling, who, if I could bring myself to
think that literature has any influence in America,
might be said to have induced us to imitate England
in her colonial policy. There comes back the picture
of Mark Twain as he sat on the veranda of the
home he had that summer at Sewell&#8217;s Bridge, a cottage
on a hill all hidden among the pines; he sat
there in his picturesque costume of white trousers
and blue jacket, with his splendid plume of white
hair, and he smoked cigar after cigar&mdash;he was an
&#8220;end to end smoker&#8221; as George Ade says&mdash;and as
he sat and smoked he drawled a delightful monologue
about some of his experiences with apparitions and
telepathy and that weird sort of thing; he said they
were not to be published during his life, and since
his death I have been waiting to see them in print.
He had just been made a Doctor of Laws by some
university in June of that year, a distinguishing fact
known to a caller from the fashionable resort of
York near by, who, though somewhat hazy as to
Mark Twain&#8217;s performances in literature, nevertheless
scrupulously addressed him as &#8220;Doctor,&#8221; and
every time he was thus recognized in his new and
scholarly dignity, he winked at us from under his
shaggy brows. Perhaps that was part of his Americanism,
too, unless it were a part of that universality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
which made him the great humorist he was, and philosopher,
too; an universality that makes Mr. Howells
a humorist as well as a novelist and a philosopher&mdash;the
elements are scarcely inseparable&mdash;though
Mr. Howells&#8217;s humor is of a more delicate
quality than that of his great friend, and, as one
might say, colleague, a quality so rare and delicate
and delightful that some folk seem to miss it altogether.
Perhaps it was the Americanism of these
two great men and their democracy that have won
them such recognition in Europe, where they have
represented the best that is in us.</p>

<p>I speak of their democracy for the purpose of
likening it in its very essence to that of Golden
Rule Jones and of Johnson, too, and of all the others
who have struggled in the human cause. We owe
Mr. Howells especially a debt in this land. He
jeopardized his standing as an artist, perhaps, by
his polemics in the cause of realism in the literary
art, but he was the first to look about him and
recognize his own land and his own people in his
fiction; that is why it is so very much the life of our
land as we know it, and to me there came long ago
a wonderful and consoling lesson, when in reading
after him, and after Tolstoy and Tourgenieff, and
Flaubert, and Zola, and Valdez, and Thomas Hardy,
I discovered that people are all alike, and like all
those about us in every essential.</p>

<p>Lincoln Steffens did not miss the humor in Mr.
Howells&#8217;s writing, because he could not miss the
humor in anything, though there was not so much
humor perhaps in another writer whom we had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
then discovered and were celebrating that day in the
joy of our discovery. It was to me a discovery of
the greatest charm, a charm that lasts to this day
in everything the man has written, that charm of the
sea and of ships, the romance and poetry of it all
which I had felt ever since as a boy I found a noble
friend in Gus Wright, an old sailor whose name I
cannot speak even now without a quickening of the
spirit because of the glamour that invested him when
I sat and looked at him and realized that he had
hunted whales in the South Pacific and had sailed the
Seven Seas. I wish I had written him into the first
of these papers, where he belongs; he made two miniature
vessels for me, one a full rigged ship, the other
a bark&mdash;dismantled now, both of them, alas, and
long since out of commission....</p>

<p>&#8220;You go down to the wharves along the East
River,&#8221; Steffens was saying, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll see a ship
come in, and after she has been made fast to her
wharf, an old man will come out of the cabin, light
his pipe, and lean over the taffrail; he&#8217;ll have a
brown, weather-beaten face, and as he leans there
smoking slowly and peacefully, his voyage done, his
eye roving calmly about here and there, you&#8217;ll look
at him, and say to yourself, &#8216;Those eyes have seen
everything in this world!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a rather big thought when you dwelt on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s seen everything in the world,&#8221; Steffens went
on, &#8220;but he can&#8217;t tell what he&#8217;s seen. Now Conrad
has those eyes, he has seen everything, and he can
tell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Joseph Conrad, of course, of whom we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
talking, the great Pole who even then had come to
a mastery of our language that might shame most
of his contemporary writers in it. I would not give
&#8220;Lord Jim&#8221; for all the other sea stories that were
ever written, not even if all the novels of Cooper
and Scott and Stevenson and Dickens were thrown
in. For Joseph Conrad can see all that the old sailor
Steffens was imagining that day could see, and far
more besides; he can see into the human soul. He
had not written &#8220;Lord Jim&#8221; at that time, or if he
had, I had not read it, nor had Steffens written his
books about municipal government, to get back to
the subject; too often, I fear, have I been thinking
about some book of Joseph Conrad when I should
have been thinking of municipal government.</p>

<p>I did not know much about municipal government
in those days, except what I had learned in Jones&#8217;s
campaigns and that theoretical knowledge I had
obtained in the courts as his attorney, and I had, I
fear, the same indifference to the subject most of
our citizens have. I should have preferred any time
to talk about literature and I should prefer to do so
now, since that is really so much more interesting
and important. But the fact that we knew nothing
about it in those days was not unusual; nobody knew
much about it except that Mr. James Bryce had
said that it was the most conspicuous failure of the
American Commonwealth, and we quoted this observation
so often that one might have supposed we
were proud of the distinction. Certainly few in
America in those days understood the subject in the
sense in which it is understood in some of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
cities, like Glasgow, for instance, whose municipal
democracy is so far ahead of ours, or in the German
cities where municipal administration is veritably a
science. But in Steffens&#8217;s case a lack of knowledge
was in itself a qualification, since he had eyes, like
the old sailor, and, like Joseph Conrad, the power to
tell what he saw. That is, Steffens had vision, imagination,
and if the history of the city in America
is ever written he will fill a large place on its page.</p>

<p>I marvel when I reflect that he could see so clearly
what most had not even the sensitiveness to feel. He
went at his task quite in the scientific spirit, isolating
first that elementary germ or microbe, the partizan,
the man who always voted the straight ticket
in municipal elections, the most virulent organism
that ever infested the body politic and as unconscious
of its toxic power as the bacillus of yellow
fever. Then he discovered the foul culture this organism
blindly breeds&mdash;the political machine, with
its boss. But he went on and his quest led him to the
public service corporation, the street railway company,
the gas company, the electricity company, and
then his trail led him out into the state, and he produced
a series of studies of politics in the American
cities which has never been equaled, and so had a
noble and splendid part in the great awakening of
our time.</p>

<p>As long as his writings exposed only the low and
the vulgar politicians, ward heelers and bosses, and
the like, he was quite popular; I believe he was even
asked to deliver addresses before clubs of the <i>dilettante</i>,
and even in churches, for the righteous were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
terrible in their wrath. But when he went more
deeply, when he exposed the respectable connections
of the machine politicians, some of his admirers fell
away, and stood afar off, like certain disciples of
old. The citizen was delighted when some city other
than his own was under the scrutiny of the sharp
eyes that gleamed behind those round glasses, but
when he drew near for a local study, there was an
uplifting of the hands in pious horror. Cincinnati
applauded the exposure of Minneapolis, and St.
Louis was pleased to have Philadelphia reformed.
Reform is popular so long as someone else is to be
reformed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXIX</h2>
</div>


<p>Steffens came to Toledo occasionally, and I recall
an evening when we sat in my library and he told
me of a certain editor with whom he had been talking;
the editor had been praising his work with a
fervor that filled Steffens with despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I write up every city in the United States
before they will see?&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I were to do
Toledo, how that chap would berate me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to Toledo early in his investigations, and
I took him to see Jones, and as we left the City
Hall in the late afternoon of that spring day, Steffens
was somehow depressed; we had walked a block
in St. Clair Street in silence when he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that man&#8217;s program will take a thousand
years!&#8221;</p>

<p>It did seem long to wait. There was a time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
I thought it might be done in a shorter period, but I
have found myself under the necessity of extending
the term from time to time. I fear now that Steffens&#8217;s
estimate of the length of Jones&#8217;s program
was rather short, but I know of no other way that
the program can be carried out. Steffens himself
is not so impatient now; he learned much more about
our cities than he ever wrote or dared to write, much
no doubt that he could not write. Great as was
the data he collected, before all the conclusions
could be drawn, all the general rules deduced, it
would be necessary to have the data of all life, of
which the cities are microcosms. The subject, after
all, is rather large.</p>

<p>But to some it seemed simple enough; were there
not policemen patroling their beats ready to arrest
the bad people? Thus in the early days of the
awakening in America impatience took on the form it
always takes with us, and men flew to the old idols
of our race, the constable and the policeman; someone
must be hounded down, someone must be put in
prison. This was the form which the awakening
took in many places, and many reputations were
built up in that wretched work, and perhaps the
inadequacy of the work is best demonstrated by the
instability of the reputations. I suppose that such
efforts do accomplish something, even though it be
at such fearful cost; they may educate some, but
mostly they seem to me to gratify a taste for cheap
sensation and reward that prurient curiosity which
has always made the contemplation of sin so very
fascinating to our race. The reformer was abroad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
seeking to make mankind over, but since he has no
model more attractive than himself to offer, his work
never goes very far, and he returns to his warfare
on the cigarette, or in moments of greater courage,
on the poor girl whose figure flits by in the darkness,
followed by the reformer&#8217;s devouring eye.</p>

<p>But Steffens did not write us up, as the reporters
phrase it. I think Jones perplexed him in those first
days, though he knows now that Jones was wholly
and I had almost said solely right. Jones indeed
perplexed most of us. A man with a program of a
thousand years could not be expected to interest so
vitally our impatient democracy, as would one with
a program so speedy and simple that it involved
nothing more complex than putting all the bad people
in jail; and there was always someone ready
to point out the bad people, so that it seemed simple,
as well it might to those who had forgotten
that even that program is six thousand years old,
at least, according to Archbishop Ussher&#8217;s chronology.
Steffens, however, was seeking types and in
the two leading cities of Ohio he found them so
perfect that he need never have gone further&mdash;had it
not been for people like that fellow citizen of ours
who filled Steffens with such despair. But while he
was gathering his data on Cincinnati and on Cleveland
he came to see us often, to our delight, and continued
to come, so that he knew our city and our
politics almost better than we knew them ourselves.
He went to Cleveland, I remember, with some distinct
prejudice against Tom Johnson; the prejudice
so easily imbibed in gentlemen&#8217;s clubs. But I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
delighted when, after his investigation, he wrote that
story in <i>McClure&#8217;s</i> which characterized Tom Johnson
as the best mayor of the best governed city in
the United States. I was delighted because I was
flattered in my own opinion, because I was fond of
Tom Johnson, and because it appeared just in the
nick of time to turn the tide in Johnson&#8217;s third
campaign.</p>

<p>Jones was delighted, too; he had said almost immediately
after Johnson became mayor of Cleveland
that he &#8220;loved him&#8221; because, in appointing the
Reverend Harris R. Cooley as Director of Charities
and Corrections, Johnson selected a man who began
at once to parole prisoners from the workhouse, and
Jones and Johnson became friends as Johnson and
Pingree had been friends. It was a peculiar instance
of the whimsical and profligate generosity of the
fates that the three cities grouped at the western
end of Lake Erie like those cities Walt Whitman
saw, or thought he saw, &#8220;as sisters with their arms
around each others&#8217; necks&#8221; should have had about
the same time three such mayors as Pingree in Detroit,
Johnson in Cleveland and Jones in Toledo,
though the three men were different in everything
except their democracy.</p>

<p>Johnson&#8217;s success in Cleveland, obtained nominally
as a Democrat, though in his campaign he was as
non-partizan as Jones himself, made him the &#8220;logical&#8221;
candidate of the Democrats in the state for
governor, and when he was nominated for that office
he burst upon the old Republican state like a new
planet flaming in the heavens. Many of the Democrats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
found that he was entirely too logical in his
democracy, since he was as like as not to denounce a
Democratic office holder as any other. He went forth
to his campaign that year in his big French touring
car, a way entirely new to us, and in the car he went
from town to town, holding his immense meetings in
a circus tent which was taken down and sent on
ahead each night. In this way he was entirely independent
of local committees, and they did not like
that very well; it had been his wealth more than his
democracy that had made him seem so logical as a
candidate to some of the Democrats. Such a spectacle
had not been seen on our country roads as
that great touring car made; it was a red car, and
the newspapers called it &#8220;the red devil&#8221;; sometimes
they were willing to apply the epithet to its occupant.
It was inevitable, of course, that provincialism
should criticize him for having bought his car
in France instead of the home market, and I shall
never forget, so irresistible in retort was he, the instant
reply he made:</p>

<p>&#8220;That complaint comes in very bad grace from
you protectionists. I bought my car in France it is
true and paid $5,000 for it, but I paid you $3,000
more in tariff duties to let me bring it home. You
made me pay for it twice and I think I own it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few have ever been vilified or abused as Johnson
was abused in our state that year; his red car might
have been a chariot of flame driven by an anarchist,
from the way some of the people talked. Strange,
inexplicable hatred in humanity for those who love
it most! Tom Johnson campaigned that year on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
platform which demanded a two-cent-a-mile railway
fare and the taxation of railroad property at something
like its value, or at least, he said the railroads
should pay in taxes as much, relatively, as a man
paid on his home; the poor man was paying on more
than a sixty per cent. valuation while the railways
were valued at eighteen or twenty per cent. This
was dangerous, even revolutionary doctrine, of
course, and Johnson was a single-taxer, supposed
in Ohio to be a method of taxation whereby everybody
would be relieved of taxation except the farmers
who were to be taxed according to the superficial
area of their farms. And of course Johnson
was defeated, and yet within two years the legislature
enacted the first of these proposals into law
with but one dissenting vote. Thus heresy becomes
orthodoxy. The proposal for taxation reform still
waits, and will wait, I fancy, for years, since it is so
fundamental, and mankind never attacks fundamental
problems until it has exhausted all the superficial
ones. And yet, while many other changes he
contended for in his day have been made, while many
of his heresies have become orthodoxies, the fear of
him possessed the rural mind in the legislature until
his death, and almost any measure could be defeated
by merely uttering the formula &#8220;Tom Johnson.&#8221;</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXX</h2>
</div>


<p>One remembers one&#8217;s friends in various attitudes,
and I see Tom Johnson now standing on the platform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
in the old tent, under the flaring lights, with
the eager crowd before him&mdash;there were never such
intelligent audiences to speak to as those in Cleveland,
unless it were those in Toledo&mdash;and he was at
his best when the crowd was heckling him. He was
like Severus Cassius, who, as Montaigne says, &#8220;spoke
best extempore, and stood more obliged to fortune
than his own diligence; it was an advantage to him
to be interrupted in speaking, and his adversaries
were afraid to nettle him, lest his anger redouble his
eloquence.&#8221; He voluntarily introduced the custom of
heckling so prevalent in England and Scotland, because
at first he was not a proficient speaker; he was
so simple, so direct, so positive, that he could state
his position in a very few words. Thus, as he told
me once, his speeches were too short for the customary
political meeting in a state where political oratory
flowed on and on indefinitely, and he asked the
crowd to put questions to him. This stirred him up,
put him on his mettle, stimulated his thought, and he
was best at this short range. And no one ever got
the better of him. Once an opponent triumphantly
demanded, in a campaign in which Johnson&#8217;s administration
was charged with extravagance:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Johnson, is it not a fact that under your
administration the Cleveland workhouse has lost
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; the Mayor replied promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you explain that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not trying to make money in the Cleveland
workhouse,&#8221; the Mayor replied instantly, &#8220;we
are trying to make MEN!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Or again I see him, superintending the tearing up
of street railway tracks, on streets where the franchises
of the private company had expired, to make
room for the rails of the city company, calmly
smoking a cigar, and with a gesture of his expressive
delicate white hand waving aside the latest of the
many injunctions that were sued out against him.
The battle was never lost to him, though his followers
were often discouraged. He might have said
of court injunctions as Napoleon said of bullets at
the battle of Krasnoi:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! They have been whistling about our legs
these forty years!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I see him best I think in the great hall of his
home in Euclid Avenue, one short, fat leg tucked comfortably
under him, his cigar in his aristocratic
hand, his friends and admirers about him. It was a
remarkable coterie of brilliant young men. One of
them had been originally an opponent, one of those
who heckled him in the tent, a fiery young radical
not long since a blacklisted mechanic who had gone
hungry when on strike, Peter Witt, one of the most
picturesque personalities in Ohio politics; he became
one of Johnson&#8217;s intimate friends and strongest supporters,
and a splendid speaker on the stump. He
was city clerk of Cleveland under all the Johnson
administrations and is now the street railway commissioner
of that city under Mayor Newton D.
Baker, who, as city solicitor, was another of the
group of those happy days. Mr. Baker was like a
boy in appearance, with his sensitive face and the
ideals of a poet, and a brilliant lawyer. He carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
all the legal burden of the long street railway controversy
in Cleveland,&mdash;it was almost a civil war&mdash;and
did it all with such skill and ability, and withal with
such grace and courtesy and good nature that he
never offended his opponents, who were the leading
corporation lawyers of the city. Frederic C. Howe
had been elected to the council in Cleveland as a
Republican from one of the most aristocratic wards,
but he was won over by Johnson&#8217;s personality, was
renominated by Johnson on the Democratic ticket,
afterwards sent to the state senate and became one
of the foremost men in the liberal movement in
America; his books on municipal government are
authorities. And Dr. Cooley; he was a Disciple
preacher, and Johnson placed him at the head of the
department of charities and corrections, so that, as
Johnson used to say, instead of a preacher Dr.
Cooley became a minister. It was delightful to be
with them in those gatherings. The genuine reform
of conditions in that city possessed them all like a
passion; they were stimulated by a common ambition,
which was, as Johnson used to say, to make
Cleveland a city set on a hill, and though he was not
a poet nor a maker of phrases everyone instinctively
knew what he meant when he spoke of his city set
on a hill. I do not know how much of history he
had read, but he knew intuitively that the city in
all ages has been the outpost of civilization, and
that if the problem of democracy is to be solved
at all it is to be solved first in the city. That was
why he struggled for the free city, struggled to make
the city democratic; he knew that the cure for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
ills of democracy is not less democracy, as so many
were always preaching, but more democracy. And
how delighted he was when Fred Howe brought out
his book &#8220;The City the Hope of Democracy.&#8221; He
had the joy of seeing marshaled there in the thesis
of a scholar all the arguments he had apprehended
but had never reduced to terms; there they were, all
in their logical order&mdash;and Johnson straightway
sent a copy of the book to every member of the
Ohio legislature, to their amazement no doubt, if not
to their amusement.</p>

<p>I used to like to go over to Cleveland and meet
that charming group Johnson had gathered about
him. There was in them a spirit I never saw in such
fullness elsewhere; they were all working for the
city, they thought only of the success of the whole.
They had the city sense, a love of their town like
that love which undergraduates have for their university,
the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the crack regiment.</p>

<p>But Johnson used to set me to work with the
rest of them. I went over there once to spend the
week&#8217;s end, for rest and relaxation, and he had me
working far into three nights on amendments to the
municipal code. He had terrible energy, but it was
a joy to work with him. I wish I had gone oftener.</p>

<p>I have said enough I hope to make it clear that
Tom Johnson was one of those mortals who have
somehow been lifted above their fellows far enough
to catch a vision of the social order which people
generally as yet do not see. It was inevitable, of
course, that such a man, especially since he was a
rich man, should have his motives impugned, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
I recall now with what a confidential chuckle he said
to me one time when he had been accused of I know
not what vaulting and wicked ambition:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am politically ambitious; I have just one ambition;
I want to be the mayor of a free city, and if I
were, the very first thing I should do would be to
appoint a corps of assessors who couldn&#8217;t see a
building, or an improvement; they would assess for
taxation nothing but the value of the land, and we
would try out the single tax.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not realize that ambition of course; no
one ever realizes his ambition. But he did perhaps
more than any other man in America to make possible
the coming of the free city in this land.</p>

<p>His struggle for three-cent railway fares in Cleveland,
which was but a roundabout method of securing
municipal ownership in a state where the legislature
in those days would not permit cities to own
their public utilities was his great work. He lived
to see that successful in a way, though not exactly
in the way he had expected; that is another irony
which the fates visit on the head of ambitious men.</p>

<p>And yet that irony of the fates is not always,
after all, unkind. Somehow, after a while, in the
lengthened perspective, the broadened vision that
reveals a larger segment of the arc, the event is seen
in better proportion. It requires faith in one&#8217;s
cause to see this always, and Johnson always had
that faith. I shall not forget how when the people
at last voted against him, he still could smile, and
say to me: &#8220;The people are probably right.&#8221; It
was the last time I saw him. He was sick then, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
dying, and sadly changed; the hair that had been so
black and curly that summer morning long before,
had grown thin and white; the face, sadly lined with
weariness, was sublimated by a new expression.
There was the same courage in the classic profile,
and the old smile was there. He was writing his
memoirs with a courage as grim as that of General
Grant&mdash;and he had the equanimity of Antoninus
Pius. And on his countenance there was the expression
of a purified ideal. So he had won; his was the
victory after all.</p>

<p>The best of life, no doubt, is made up of memories,
as M. George Cain says, and perhaps that is
why I have lingered so long over these little incidents
of Sam Jones and Tom Johnson. I have told them
in no sort of related order; Jones died years before
Johnson; but somehow they seem to me to have appeared
simultaneously, like twin stars in our northern
sky, to have blazed a while and then gone out together.
Different as their personalities were, different
as two such great originals must have been,
they were one in ideal, and even in their last words
they expressed the vast toil and strain of the efforts
they put forth to attain it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it worth while?&#8221; asked Tom Johnson of his
friend Newton Baker, a day or two before he died.
And Sam Jones on that last day turned to his sister
Nell, the noble spirit who had conducted the settlement
work at Golden Rule House, and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;&#8216;He that endureth to the end&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; What does
it say?&#8221;</p>

<p>She repeated the Scripture to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it in Welsh,&#8221; he said, his thought returning
in those ultimate moments to the speech they had
used as children. But before she could direct her
mind into the old sequences, the end had come.</p>

<p>At least, there were those in town who thought it
was the end. The stock of the street railway company
went up twenty-four points the next morning,
and some brokers issued a letter saying now that
Jones had died the securities of that enterprise offered
a golden investment&mdash;about the most authentic
extant illustration, I suppose, of the utter contemptibility
of privilege in these states. The politicians
often had been heard to say that when Jones retired
the non-partizan movement in Toledo would come to
an end; in their professional analyses they had pronounced
it a personal following not governed by
principle, and that with the passing of the leader
it would disappear and the voters become tractable
and docile partizan automata again. And now that
Jones was dead and one of their organization, the
president of the council, was to succeed to the
mayor&#8217;s office, the hopes they had so long entertained
seemed at last on the point of realisation. Within a
few weeks, therefore, an ordinance granting the
street railway company a renewal of its rights was
passed by the council.</p>

<p>Then, instantly, the old spirit flamed anew; there
were editorials, mass meetings, and all sorts of protest
against the action, and in response to this indignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
public feeling, the acting mayor, Mr. Robert
H. Finch, very courageously vetoed the ordinance.
But the machine &#8220;had the votes,&#8221; and on the following
Monday night the council met to pass the ordinance
over the veto. The members of the Republican
organization were there, favored with seats in
the office of the city clerk; lobbyists and the legal
representatives of the street railway company were
there. The chamber was crowded; the hot air of the
small, low-ceiled room was charged with a nervous
tension; there was in it an eager expectant quality,
not unmixed with dread and fear and guilt. The
atmosphere was offensive to the moral sense&mdash;a condition
remarked in other halls in this land when
councils and legislatures have been about to take
action that was inimical to the public good.</p>

<p>But the machine councilmen bore themselves
jauntily enough; the windows were open to the soft
night of the early autumn, and now and then some
one sauntered in nonchalance over to the windows,
and looked down into St. Clair Street, garish in the
white and brilliant light of the electric signs of
theaters, restaurants and saloons. The theater
crowds were already going by, but it was to be
noted that they loitered that evening, and were re&euml;nforced
by other saunterers, as though the entertainment
of the pavement might surpass that of the
painted scene within. And above all the noises of
the street, clanged the gongs of the street cars gliding
by, and, for the moment, as a dramatic center of
the scene, a squad of policemen was stationed in the
lobby of the council chamber.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>This nervous, sinister mood was somehow abroad in
the whole city that night. Mr. Negley D. Cochran
had written another editorial, published that evening
in heavy type, in the <i>News-Bee</i>, calling on the
citizens to come out and protect their rights in
the streets of their city, so that there were apprehensions
of all sorts of danger and disaster.</p>

<p>The council proceeded with its business; the voice
of the reading clerk droned on in the resolutions
and ordinances that represented the normal municipal
activities of that hour, and then, suddenly, a
sound of a new and unaccustomed sort arose from
St. Clair Street, the sound of the tramp of marching
men. Those at the windows, looking out, saw a
strange spectacle&mdash;not without its menace; the
newspaper reporters, some of them, embellished their
reports with old phrases about faces blanching.
Perhaps they did; they might well have done so, for
the men came down St. Clair Street not as a mob;
they were silent, marching in column, by sets of
fours, with an orderly precision and a discipline
almost military. And at their head there was a man
whose square, broad shoulders and firm stride were
the last expression of determination. He wore a
slouch hat, under which his gray hair showed; his
closely trimmed beard was grizzled; he looked, as
many noted, not unlike the conventional portraits
of General Grant. The man was Mr. Johnson
Thurston, and he was as grim as General Grant, as
brave, as determined, and as cool. He was widely
known in Toledo as a lawyer, however, not as a
politician; he had never been in politics, indeed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
he was in politics that night, surely, and destined
to remain in politics for years to come.</p>

<p>He brought his column to a halt under the windows
of the council chamber. There was no room
in that small chamber for such a delegation, or
seemingly for any delegation of the people, however
small. Johnson Thurston&#8217;s son marched beside him
as an aide, bearing a soap box&mdash;the modern tribune
of our democracy&mdash;and he placed it on the pavement
for his father. A street car, just then halting,
clanged its gong for the throng to make way,
and at this perfect symbol of the foe they were
opposing, Johnson Thurston shook his fist, and
shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand there! The people are attending to their
business to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>The street car stood, and Johnson Thurston
mounted his soap box, produced a paper and read
from it in a loud voice that section of the Constitution
in which the people retain to themselves the
right peaceably to assemble and petition for a
redress of grievances. And this done, he turned to
his followers, gave them a signal, and there went up
from their throats in perfect unison a mighty cry:
&#8220;Let the franchise alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>Three times they voiced their imperative mandate,
and then, at a signal, they wheeled about, and
marched away in the excellent order in which they
had come. Such a demonstration, in the streets, at
night, before a legislative body, had it occurred in
a capital or in a metropolis, would have been historic.
As it was, the cry that went up from those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
men was heard in the council chamber; and it was
destined to ring through the town for the better
part of a decade. The council did not pass
the ordinance over the Mayor&#8217;s veto; half an
hour later the councilmen were escorted from their
chamber by the police they had summoned; and a
sadly shaken body they were, poor fellows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men who had marched with Johnson
Thurston had retired to a vacant storeroom in
Superior Street, three blocks away, over the door
of which there was a canvas sign bearing the inscription
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Independent Headquarters</span>.&#8221; There
they had assembled and been drilled by Johnson
Thurston, as college men are drilled by a leader in
their yells, and with a solemn sense of civic duty they
had marched to the council chamber to save their
city from a quarter of a century more of shameful
vassalage to a privileged public utility corporation.
The threat of their presence had been sufficient, but
had that proved unavailing, they had provided other
resources. There had been all the while, from the
hour of the opening of the doors that night, twelve
men in the council chamber, armed with bombs, not
of dynamite or any such anarchist explosive, but
of asaf&#339;tida and sulphureted hydrogen and I know
not what other overpowering fumes and odors, confidently
relied upon to prevail against even so foul
a stench as that which a privileged plutocracy can
make in any of the halls of government when it has
determined to secure another lease of its tenure.</p>

<p>At Independent Headquarters, then, that autumn,
political meetings were held, in which local affairs&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
street-car situation especially and the relation
it bore to the machines of political parties&mdash;were
discussed. Because of those changes the legislature
was always making in the government of cities, three
councilman at large were to be elected. This was
in the year 1904, in the midst of a national campaign.
Roosevelt was running for president for his
second&mdash;or his first term, depending on the point
of view&mdash;and three of those men who had voted for
that street railway ordinance, and were ready to
vote to pass it over the mayor&#8217;s veto, were candidates
on the Republican ticket for councilmen at
large. The Independents who had marched with
Johnson Thurston determined to nominate a city
ticket, and they honored me by offering me the place
at the head of that ticket as their candidate for
councilman at large. I was writing another novel
just then and battling as usual against interruptions,
and so I begged off; it was not the campaign
I feared, but, as I told them, the fear that I should
be elected. We nominated a ticket, and went into
the campaign, speaking every night, and in November,
though Roosevelt carried the city by fifteen
thousand, our candidates for councilmen at large
were elected. Clearly, then, the non-partizan movement
had not wholly died with Golden Rule Jones;
his soul, like the soul of John Brown, was marching
on, and still somehow led by him, and inspired by
his spirit, there had sprung forth, like Greek soldiers
from the dragon&#8217;s teeth, in Toledo a democratic
municipal movement. First of all the cities
in America, she had taken the initial step in freeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
herself, the step all cities in America must take if
they would free themselves from their masters&mdash;that
of non-partizan municipal elections.</p>

<p>The predilection of the Ohio man for politics, I
believe, is well known in this land, where it is generally
identified with a love for office. There is a
reproach implied in the reputation which we perhaps
deserve. An Ohio man goes into politics as
naturally as a Nova Scotian goes to sea, and yet
not all Nova Scotians go to sea. They all love the
sea perhaps, but they do not all care to become
sailors. And so with us Ohioans. We all love politics,
though fortunately we do not all care to hold
office, even if most people do smile indulgently when
the modest disinclination is expressed. Perhaps such
scepticism is quite natural in a land so saturated in
privilege that even office holding is regarded in that
light&mdash;or was until recently, for now a new conception
is expanding in the public consciousness and
there is hope that ere long public office will be regarded
as a responsibility. I was quite sure that
I did not care to be a councilman&mdash;that weekly
wrangle, by night, in a room choking with the fumes
of cheap tobacco, known as the session of the common
council, was far from my tastes. And when
the mayoralty was suggested to me I was quite as
certain that I did not wish that. For it was not
long after the death of Jones that it was suggested;
by Tom Johnson for one, who, in his blunt way, told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
me that I should run for the place; and by Steffens,
who, just then in Cleveland, was writing the article
in which Tom Johnson was celebrated as &#8220;the best
mayor of the best governed city in America,&#8221; and
Steffens found time now and then to come over to
Toledo to see us. &#8220;And another thing,&#8221; he wrote to
me after one of these visits, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to run for
mayor.&#8221; He reached this conclusion, I believe, by a
process of inversion. He had been talking with some
of the machine politicians, and it was their objection
to me as a candidate that caused him to see my duty
in that light. I was at one with them on that point,
at any rate; they could have been no more reluctant
to have me run than I myself was. Tom Johnson,
when the Democrats met in their state convention
at Columbus that year, might propose me for governor,
and the delegation of his county, Cuyahoga,
and the delegation from my own county of Lucas
vote for my nomination, but that stroke of political
lightning was easily arrested by rods that had been
more accurately and carefully adjusted, so that I
could take the manuscript of &#8220;The Turn of the Balance&#8221;
and go to Wequetonsing on the shores of Little
Traverse Bay, where the days are blue and gold,
and there is sparkling sunshine, and a golf links
where one may find happiness, if he is on his game, or
if he is not, consolation in that noble view from the
hill&mdash;the tee at the old fourth and the new twelfth
hole&mdash;when he may, if he wish, imagine himself in
Italy overlooking the Bay of Naples&mdash;which is no
more beautiful. Meredith Nicholson, a hale old
Hoosier friend, as James Whitcomb Riley used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
phrase it, was there, too, near the spot where he
wrote that excellent novel, &#8220;The Main Chance,&#8221; and
in that country place with him and other charming
friends near by I spent the summer. But when I
came home in the autumn the campaign was already
on, and the Independents had all but nominated me
as their candidate for mayor.</p>

<p>They were forced to make their nominations by
petition, and on the petitions proposing me for the
office there were many thousands of names, pages
that were stained with the grime and dust and grease
of factories and shops&mdash;a diploma in its way, which
might have made one proud, had not the prospect
been one to make one so very unhappy. For I
knew what the mayoralty had done to Jones. I had
come to realize in my association with him that there
is no position more difficult than that of the mayor
of a large city in the America of our times, for the
city is a kind of microcosm where are posited in
miniature all the problems of a democracy, and the
fact that they are in miniature only increases the
difficulty. My ambitions lay in another field, and
besides I had a feeling against it, dim and vague,
though since adequately expressed in one of those fine
generalizations which Se&ntilde;or Guglielmo Ferrero
makes on his brilliant page; &#8220;there is no sphere of
activity,&#8221; he says, writing of the perils of political
life, &#8220;which is so much at the mercy of unforeseen
accidents or where the effort put out is so incommensurable
with the result obtained.&#8221; It is, of course,
one of the privileges of the citizen in a democracy
to be &#8220;mentioned&#8221; for public office; if no one else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
mentions him he can mention himself, and whenever
someone else does mention him there are many who
ascribe to his originality the credit for the suggestion.</p>

<p>It seems difficult for our people to understand any
man who really does not desire public office in a
land where it has so long been regarded purely as
a privilege to be bestowed or a prize to be contested.
I suppose that even the blunt and grim old warrior
Sherman caused the people to smile when he said
that if nominated for the presidency he would not
accept and if elected he would not serve. They
wondered what he meant, and for a time it never occurred
to them that he meant just what he said.</p>

<p>But the day came at last when I must decide,
and to a committee of the Independents I said that I
should give them an answer in the morning. I
thought it all over again in the watches of the night,&mdash;and
the unfinished manuscript on my library table&mdash;and
at last, since somebody had to do it, since
somebody had to point out at least the danger of
risking the community rights in the hands of a political
machine, I said I would accept. I suppose
that it is but an expression of that ironic mood in
which the Fates delight to deal with mortals that it
should be so easy to get that which one does not
want; the Independents insisted on my standing for
the office, but the only humor in that fact was just
then too grim for pleasure, though there is always a
compensation somewhere after all, and gloomy as I
was that morning at the prospect of the bitter campaign
and the difficulties that would follow if I were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
elected, I could laugh when &#8220;Dad&#8221; McCullough, the
old Scotsman whom we all loved for himself and for
his devotion to our movement, leaned forward in his
chair, stroked his whiskers in a mollifying way and,
as though he preferred even the other members of
his committee not to hear him, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it be out of place if I suggested that in
the campaign you bear down as lightly as possible
on the infirmities of the law?&#8221;</p>

<p>His shrewd sense even then warned him of the
herring that would be drawn across the trail of
privilege as soon as we struck it!</p>

<p>And he was right. We had not opened our campaign
at Golden Rule Hall, before privilege did
what it always does when it is pursued, it tried to
divert attention from itself by pointing out a smaller
evil. All the old and conventional complaints about
the morals of the city to which we had been used
in Jones&#8217;s campaigns were revived and repeated with
embellishments and improvements; no city was ever
reviled as was ours by those who had failed in their
efforts to control it and absorb the product of its
communal toil. My attitude, conceived by &#8220;Dad&#8221;
McCullough as &#8220;bearing down on the infirmities of
the law,&#8221; was now represented as evidence of an intention
to ignore the law, to enforce none of the
statutes, and it was predicted that the election of
the Independent ticket meant nothing but anarchy
and chaos.</p>

<p>To this &#8220;moral&#8221; issue that had served for so
many years, the &#8220;good&#8221; people responded immediately,
as they always do, and with certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of the clergy to lead them rallied instantly about
the machine, and for six weeks reveled in an
inspection of all the city&#8217;s vices, and mouseled in
the slums and stews of the tenderloin for examples
of the depravity which they declared it was the purpose
and design of the Independents to intensify
and perpetuate. Their own candidate had been in
power for a year and a half and these conditions
had existed unmolested, but when some of our speakers
indicated this inconsistency in their attitude they
only raged the more.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all this, the issue was clear;
the machine had helped to make it clear, not only
by its long opposition to Jones, but more recently
by its efforts for the street railway company. It
was the old issue between privilege and democracy,
that has marked the cleavage in society in all ages.
The people were trying to take back their own government,
for the purpose, first, of preventing the
street railway company from securing another lease
of the city&#8217;s streets for a quarter of a century, by
which, incidentally, the company would realize profits
on about twenty-five million dollars of watered
stock. But the people were not to be deceived; they
were not to be turned off the trail so easily; and the
entire ticket was elected, so that at the beginning of
that new year the Independents were in control of
every branch of the government, not only in the city,
but in the county as well.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIII</h2>
</div>


<p>I have spoken of the Independents as though they
were an authentic political party, when it was one
of their basic principles to be no party at all. They
were Republicans and Democrats who, in the revelation
of Jones&#8217;s death, had come to see that it was
the partizan that was responsible for the evil political
machines in American cities; they saw that
by dividing themselves arbitrarily into parties, along
national lines, by voting, almost automatically, their
party tickets, ratifying nominations made for them
they knew not how, they were but delivering over
their city to the spoiler. As Republicans, proud
of the traditions of that party, they had voted
under the impression that they were voting for Lincoln;
as Democrats they thought they were voting
for Jefferson, or at least for Jackson, but they had
discovered that they had been voting principally for
the street railway company and the privileges allied
with it in interest.</p>

<p>And more than all, they saw that in the amazing
superstition of party regularity by which the partizan
mind in that day was obsessed, they were voting
for these interests no matter which ticket they
supported, for the machine was not only partizan, it
was bipartizan, and the great conflict they waged
at the polls was the most absurd sham battle that
ever was fought. It seems almost incredible now
that men&#8217;s minds were ever so clouded, strange that
they did not earlier discover how absurd was a system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
which, in order to enable them the more readily
to subjugate themselves, actually printed little wood-cuts
of birds&mdash;roosters and eagles&mdash;at the heads of
the tickets, so that they might the more easily and
readily recognize their masters and deliver their suffrages
over to them. It is an absurdity that is
pretty well recognized in this country to-day, and
the principle of separating municipal politics from
national politics is all but established in law. Mr.
James Bryce had pointed it out long before, but
Jones seemed to be almost the first among us to
recognize it, and he probably had not read from
Mr. Bryce; he deduced the principle from his
own experience, and from his own consciousness, if
not his own conscience, perhaps he had some intimation
of it from the Genius of These States, whose
scornful laugh at that and other absurdities his
great exemplar Walt Whitman could hear, echoed as
from some mountain peak afar in the west. But it
was no laughing matter in Toledo in those days.
Men were accused of treason and sedition for deserting
their parties; it made little difference which
party a man belonged to; the insistence was on his
belonging to a party; any party would suffice.</p>

<p>I have no intention, however, of discussing that
principle now, but it was the point from which we
had to start in our first campaign, the point from
which all cities will have to start if they wish to be
free. The task we faced was relatively greater than
that which Jones had faced; we had a full ticket in
the field, a candidate for every city office and a man
running for the council in every ward in town.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Jones had run alone, and though he succeeded there
was always a council and a coterie of municipal officials
who represented the other interest in the community.
Of course he had made our work possible
by the labor he had done, great pioneer that he
was. He had been his own platform, as any candidate
after all must be, but with our large movement
it was necessary to reduce our principles to some
form and we tried to do this as simply as we could.
We put forth our belief that local affairs should
be separate from, and independent of, party politics,
and that public officers should be selected on
account of their honesty and efficiency, regardless
of political affiliations; that the people should be
more active in selecting their officials, and should
not allow an office-seeker to bring about his own
nomination; that the prices charged by public
service corporations should be regulated by the
council at stated intervals; and that all franchises
for public utilities should first be submitted to a
vote of the people, that the city should possess the
legal right to acquire and maintain any public utility,
when authorized so to do by direct vote of its
people, that every franchise granted to public service
corporations should contain an agreement that the
city might purchase and take over its property at a
fair price, whenever so voted by the people, and that
no street railway franchise should be extended or
granted, permitting more than three-cent fares, and
unless it includes provision for universal transfers,
satisfactory service, and reasonable compensation
for the use of bridges, and we demanded from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
legislature home rule, the initiative and referendum
and the recall.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not such a little platform after
all, but big indeed, I think, when one comes to consider
its potentialities, and if anyone thinks it was
easy to put its principles into practice, let him
try it and see! It was drawn by that Johnson
Thurston of whom I spoke, and by Oren Dunham
and by Elisha B. Southard and others, citizens devoted
to their town, and already with a prescience
of the city spirit. They succeeded in compressing
into those few lines all we know or need to know
about municipal government, and ages hence our
cities will still be falling short of the ideal they expressed
on that little card. There were many who
went with us in that first campaign who did not see
all the implications of that statement of principles;
none of us saw all of them of course. The
movement had not only the strength but the weaknesses
of all so-called reform movements in their
initial stages. Those who were disappointed or
disaffected or dissatisfied for personal reasons with
the old party machines, no doubt found an opportunity
for expression of their not too lofty sentiments,
although later on when they saw that it was
merely a tendency toward democracy they fell away,
not because the movement had deserted its original
ideals but because they at last understood them.</p>

<p>As I now look back on that first campaign, on the
experience I had so much dreaded, the perspective
has worked its magic, and the hardships and difficulties
have faded away, even, I hope, as its enmities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
have faded away, though remembering Jones&#8217;s
admonition to &#8220;draw the sting&#8221; I tried to keep enmities
out of it. Since I could not bring myself
to discuss myself, I resolved not to discuss my opponents,
and I went through the campaign without
once mentioning the name of one of them&mdash;there
were four candidates for mayor against me&mdash;without
making one personal reference to them. And never
in any political campaign since have I attacked an
opponent. It was enough to discuss the principles
of our little platform; and the first task was to get
the electors to see the absurdity of their partizanship
and to make clear the necessity of having a
city government that represented the people or,
since that phrase is perhaps indefinite, one that did
not represent the privileged interests of the city.</p>

<p>The campaign was like the old Jones campaigns,
though not altogether like them.</p>

<p>The legislature, which is always interfering as
much as possible with the cities, had changed the
time of holding the municipal elections from the
spring to the autumn, one change wrought by a legislature
in cities that the people approved, since
instead of those raw spring winds we now have the
glorious weather the autumn usually brings us in
the lake regions, with a sparkling air and a warm
sun, and a long procession of golden days, on which
one really should be playing golf, if one could play
golf in the midst of a political campaign, which
one could not, since art and politics, or at least the
practice of them, are wholly incompatible.</p>

<p>There was no old gray Molly to jog about from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
one meeting to another, and if there had been, she
could not have jogged fast enough for the necessities
of that hour; and we established new precedents
when Percy Jones, the son of the Golden Rule
Mayor, drove me about at furious speed in his big
touring car, the &#8220;Grey Ghost&#8221; the reporters called
it, and it streaked through the night, with its siren
singing, from place to place until I had spoken at
half a dozen meetings. Every day at noon it wheeled
up to the entrance of the factories and shops as the
men were coming out for their noon hour. And
such meetings I believe were never held anywhere;
there was an inspiration as the men crowded about
the car to hear the speeches; they were not politicians,
they were seeking nothing, they were interested
in their city; and in their faces, what is far
above any of these considerations, there was an eager
interest in life, perhaps a certain hunger of life
which in so many of them, such were the conditions
of their toil, was not satisfied.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIV</h2>
</div>


<p>As I sat and looked out over the crowds that
poured from the shops and stood, sometimes for the
whole of the noon hour, in discomfort perhaps if
the wind was off the lake, and saw the veritable
hunger for life that was in their faces, a hunger
surely which no political or economic system, however
wise and perfect, could satisfy, I could not help
thinking that it was a pity the clergy did not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
these people better, for, after all, the message
of the Carpenter who came out of Nazareth was for
the workers and the poor, and He had passionately
thrown Himself on their side. It might have been
suggested to that pastor who complained bitterly
that his own pews were empty on Sunday evenings
while the streets outside his church were crowded
with people who for one evening at least were joyous
and free from care, that the Master whom he
served would have asked no better congregation than
they and no better auditorium than the street.</p>

<p>But this pastor was used to making suggestions,
not to receiving them; he was not of a mind as open
as that one who actually came to me once to ask
me how he could get the workingmen to hear him
preach. He had not failed, he said, to go to them;
he had advertised on a placard hung at the entrance
of a factory where two thousand men were working
that on a Monday at noon he would speak to them.
They had known of him, for he had recently been
celebrated in the newspapers as having inaugurated
a crusade to close the cheap theaters, whose lurid
melodramas,&mdash;I believe lurid is the word in that connection
unless the melodramas are &#8220;novelized&#8221; and
sold for a dollar and a half,&mdash;he said, were detrimental
to morals, as no doubt they were. And so
when he appeared, punctually, on that Monday
noon, at the rendezvous appointed by his poster,
the workingmen were ready and, when he stood up
to preach to them, they received him with a deafening
din, made by pounding on pieces of metal they
had brought from the shop, so that the poor fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
could not speak at all, and when, with roars of
awful laughter they unfurled some ribald banner
fresh from the paint shop of their establishment,
advising him to go to hell where he was always consigning
so many of his fellow human beings, he
went away quite broken-hearted. It was in that
mood and perhaps a little chastened by his experience
that he came to see me. I could agree with
him, of course, that the men had acted like the perfect
barbarians they could be at times, but there
was nothing I could do for him, nothing I could tell
him. I learned long ago that you cannot tell a man
anything unless he knows it already!</p>

<p>And yet that preacher&#8217;s case was perfectly simple.
He had come to the city not long before, and
of course, had come from the country. His training
and his experience had all been rural, he knew
nothing whatever of the life of our cities or of their
problems; he thought only in agrarian sequences.
He had a little code of conduct consisting of a few
perfectly simple negatives, namely, men should not
use tobacco, or liquor, or attend theaters or circuses,
or play with colored cards, or violate (that is,
do anything pleasant on) the Sabbath day. And
whenever he saw people doing any of these things
it was his duty to dissuade them from doing them,
and if he could not dissuade them, then it was the
duty of the authorities to force the people to stop
doing these things by sending policemen after them.
Poverty was caused either by drink, or by idleness,
though usually by drink, and if the saloons were
closed, drinking would cease!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>This was the man&#8217;s conception. Of the condition
of the workingmen in the cities he had literally no
notion. He knew they worked, and that working
made them tired, of course, just as it made farmers
tired. He saw no difference between the labor in
the agricultural field and that in the industrial field.
That men who had been shut up in dusty factories
for six days, working intently at whirling machines,
under the bulb of an electric light, felt, when they
came to the one day of rest, that they should like
to go outdoors and breathe the air, and have some relaxation,
some fun, had never occurred to him. That
they had to work so hard, too, that stimulants were
perhaps a necessity, never occurred to him, just as
it had never occurred to him that when one of these
workers left home there was no place for him to go
unless he went to a saloon, where there were light
and warmth and companionship, and, above all, liberty;
or to a cheap theatre or in the summer to a
baseball game. And he could not understand why
these men resented his suggestion that they give up
all these things, and instead do as farmers do on
Sunday, or as they pretend to do, that is, stay indoors,
or, if they do go out, go out to attend church.</p>

<p>And what was most curious of all, he had not the
slightest notion of what we meant when we spoke of
the street railway problem. He knew, of course,
that it was proposed to reduce the fare a cent or
two cents, but that was not important; what were
two cents? That there was anything immoral in
watering stock, in seizing millions of the communal
value, had never occurred to him, and in the midst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
of all the complexities of city life he remained utterly
na&iuml;ve, bound up in his little code, with not
the glimmer of a ray of light on social conditions
or problems, or of economics, or, in a word, of life.
To him there were no social problems that the Anti-Saloon
League could not solve in a week, if wicked
officials would only give them enough policemen and
a free rein to do it.</p>

<p>And so he wondered why the workingmen would
not come to hear him preach, or at least would not
listen to him at the door of their shop!</p>

<p>And most of the parsons in the town&mdash;at that
time, though it is not so any more, so rapidly have
changes come in our thought&mdash;were of this frame of
mind. Not one of them supported our cause; many
of them denounced it, and continued to denounce
it, for years. Now and then there was one who
might whisper to me privately that he understood
and favored our efforts, but not one ever spoke out
publicly, unless it were to denounce us. And several
times they attacked me in their prayers. For instance,
if&mdash;after I became mayor&mdash;I went to deliver
an address of welcome, and a preacher was
there to open the assembly with prayer, he sometimes
would take advantage of the situation and, in
the pretense of asking a blessing on the &#8220;chief magistrate
of our beloved city,&#8221; point out my short-comings
and read me a lecture on my duties with
his eyes shut and his hands folded. To that attack
it would have been necessary, I presume, though I
am not quite sure of the ecclesiastical etiquette, to
reply with my eyes shut and my hands folded, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Jones had said: &#8220;When He was reviled, He reviled
not again,&#8221; and &#8220;He that endureth to the end.&#8221; It
seemed as good a plan as any. I never replied to
these or any other of their attacks. Some of the
leaders of our movement always insisted that the
preachers opposed us because they were influenced,
according to the historical precedents, by their economic
dependence on the privileged class. But if
that is true I am sure the influence was unconscious
in most cases, and that they simply did not understand.
They were all desperately sincere. That
was the chief difficulty with them.</p>

<p>Indeed, I found it better never to reply to any
criticisms or attacks whatever. The philosophy of
that attitude has been pretty well set forth I think
by Emerson, though it has been so long since I have
read it that I do not now know in which of his essays
or his poems or his lectures he revealed it, though
probably it would be found in all three since, shrewd
Yankee that he was, he cast every thought he had
in three forms. Had he lived in our day he might
in addition have dramatized each one of them. But
from his advice never to apologize, one may proceed
to the virtue of never explaining. It saves an immense
amount of time and energy, for since a politician&#8217;s
enemies are legion, and are constantly increasing
in number, and can attack him, as it were,
in relays, he must have enormous energy if he is to
reply in detail to all of them; he will find himself
after a while more desperately involved than was the
man in Kipling&#8217;s story, who through the Indian Government
kept his enemy toiling night and day to answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
foolish questions about pigs, and, what was
worse, explaining his previous answers.</p>

<p>Telling what one is going to do is equally as
foolish as explaining what one has done, or denying
what one has not done, and so promises could be
dispensed with as easily as retorts and explanations.
Long catalogues of promised prodigies and miracles
are of course absurd, and the bawling and blowing
politician (as Walt Whitman called him) can
make them as fluently in his evil cause as can the
purest of the reformers. I had been disgusted too
often with such performances to be able to enter
into competition of that sort, and so let our little
platform speak for itself and did not even promise
to be good. And the people understood.</p>

<p>I have often heard men complain of the strain
and fatigue of political campaigning, and I sometimes
think much of their distress arises from the
fact that they campaign in ways that are not necessary,
if nothing more derogatory is to be said of
them. There is of course the fatigue that comes
of nervous strain and anxiety, and this is very great,
but the haggard visage and the husky voice are all
unnecessary. It is no wonder to be sure that some
men break down in campaigns, since their cause
is so bad that anyone might well be expected to
sicken in its advocacy, and in furthering it it is
perhaps inevitable that their efforts partake in a
measure of its corruption. There is no exercise that
is physically more beneficial than speaking, especially
speaking in the open air, provided one knows
how to use his voice and does not attempt to shout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
up the wind; and two or three speeches at noon, just
before luncheon and four or five more in the evening
after dinner may be recommended as an excellent
course in physical culture, if when one is done one&#8217;s
speeches for the evening one will go home and, for
an hour, read, say &#8220;Huckleberry Finn&#8221; or &#8220;Tom
Sawyer&#8221; before he goes to bed. I can recommend
these two great American novels with entire confidence
in their power to refresh, and in their deep
and true and delightful philosophy to correct aberrations
in the point of view&mdash;of one&#8217;s self, in the
first place, and of some other things of much more
importance than one&#8217;s self. If the cause be one in
which one believes there is an incomparable exhilaration
in it all. And it was with some pride that I
came through that first campaign without having
lost either my temper or my voice.</p>

<p>There must always remain the memory of those
throngs in the meetings, those workingmen who
came pouring out of the shops and factories at noon,
glad as school boys to be released for a little while
from toil, laughing, whistling, engaging in rude
pleasantries, jostling, teasing and joking each
other, and then, suddenly, pausing, gathering about
the motor car, drawing closer, pressing up to
the foot-board, and listening, with eager, intent
faces, in which there was such instant appreciation
of a joke, a pleasantry, anything to make them
laugh, and yet somehow the adumbration of a yearning
and a hope. Lyman Wachenheimer&mdash;who as
judge of the police court once had fined Jones for
contempt of court, but had come later to agree with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
him and now was candidate for prosecuting attorney
of the county&mdash;would stand up in the car, lean
over, and speak to them out of the splendid new
faith in democracy that had come to him, and the
rest of us in our turn would speak. We did not
ask them to vote for us; our message was at least
higher than that old foolish and selfish appeal. First
of all we wished them to vote for themselves, we
wished them to vote their own convictions, and not
merely to follow with the old partizan blindness the
boss or the employer or someone else who told
them how to vote. And all too soon for the orators
warming to their work&mdash;they must speak rapidly,
they must speak simply and come to the point, for
the demands of the street meeting are obdurate
and out under the open sky there is short shrift for
insincerity or any of the old pretense and buncombe&mdash;the
whistle blows, the men turn and scatter, the
crowd melts away, a few linger to the last minute
to catch the last word, and then they turn and run,
and as they go they lift high the perpendicular
hand&mdash;Walt Whitman&#8217;s sign of democracy....
Do you know it? Sometimes one of the section gang
working on the railroad, pausing in his labor while
the Limited sweeps by, looks up and to the idle one
on the rear platform of the observation car, going
for his long holiday, he waves his hand in a gesture
instinct with grace and the sincere greeting of a
fellow human being, and perhaps because&mdash;alas!&mdash;the
moment of their swift and instantly passing communication
is isolated from all the complexities of
our civilized life, because it is to vanish too soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
for the differences men have made between themselves
to assert their distinction, there is that one
instant of perfect understanding. Sometimes a man
in a boat sailing by will hail you with this gesture
from his passing craft; he is safe from long contact,
he can run a risk and for that little moment yield
to the adventure of picking up an acquaintance.
Sometimes it is the engineer of a locomotive leaning
out of his cab window, giving you perhaps a
droll wink, and there are tramps who from a box
car will exchange a friendly greeting. And I shall
never forget the little Irish sailor up on the boat
deck with whom I talked in the early darkness of an
autumn evening in the middle of the Atlantic, with
the appalling loneliness of the sea as night came
down to meet it in mystery, and the smoke from the
funnels trailed up off to the southwest on a rising
and sinister wind; he told me of his mother and his
uncle&mdash;&#8220;who makes his five guineas a week and
doesn&#8217;t know the taste of liquor&#8221;&mdash;and of his little
ambitions, and so, after a bit, of the mysteries of
life, with a perfect <i>camaraderie</i>, as we stood there
leaning over the rail, and then, suddenly, when we
parted, invested himself with a wholly different manner,
and touched his cap in a little salute and left me
to the inanities of the smoking-room.</p>

<p>It was something like that, those intimacies,
vouchsafed for a moment in our early meetings,
whether those at noon or those at night, in the suffocating
little halls, or the cold tent, with the torches
tossing their flames in your eyes as you spoke, and
it was even that way in those curious meetings down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
in the darker quarter of the town, where the waste of
the city lifted up faces that were seared and scarred
with the appalling catastrophes of the soul that had
somehow befallen them, and there was unutterable
longing there.</p>

<p>The one thing that marred these contacts was
not only that one was so powerless to help these men,
but that one stood before them in an attitude that
somehow suggested to them, inevitably, from long
habit and the pretense of men who sought power for
themselves, that one needed only to be placed in a
certain official relation to them, and to be addressed
by a certain title, to be able to help them. It was
enough to make one ashamed, almost enough to cause
one to prefer that they should vote for someone else,
and relieve one from this dreadful self-consciousness,
this dreadful responsibility.</p>

<p>And these were the people! These were they who
had been so long proscribed and exploited; they
had borne a few of the favored of the fates on their
backs, and yet, bewildered, they were somehow expectant
of that good to come to them which had
been promised in the words and phrases by which
their very acquiescence and subjugation had so mysteriously
been wrought&mdash;&#8220;Life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where? And for them, when? Not through the
efforts of those who employed cold phrases about
&#8220;good&#8221; government, and &#8220;reform,&#8221; and &#8220;business&#8221;
administrations, and efficiency methods, and enforcement
of the laws, and law and order, and all that
sort of thing, and class consciousness, and economic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
or any other interpretation of history, or
through initiatives, referendums and recalls. What
good would any of these cold and precise formul&aelig;
do them? Better perhaps the turkey at Thanksgiving,
and the goose at Christmas time which the
old machine councilman from the ward gave them;
of course they themselves paid for them, but they
did not know it, and the councilman did not know it;
he had bestowed them with the voice of kindness,
in the same hearty human spirit in which he came
to the wedding or the wake, or got the father a
job, or the oldest son a parole from the workhouse,
and rendered a thousand other little personal services.
Perhaps Bath House John and Hinky Dink
were more nearly right after all than the cold and
formal and precise gentleman who denounced their
records in the council. For they were human, and
the great problem is to make the government of a
city human.</p>

<p>There were many, of course, even in our own
movement, who were not concerned about that; I was
strongly rebuked by one of them once in that very
first campaign for declaring that we were no better
than anyone else, and that all the &#8220;good&#8221; men of
the world could not do the people much good even if
they were elected to the city government for life. No,
we may have efficient governments in our cities, and
honest governments, as we are beginning to have
everywhere, and, happily, are more and more to
have, but the great emancipations will not come
through the formul&aelig; of Independents, Socialists, or
single-taxers, nor through Law and Order Leagues,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
nor Civic Associations. Down in their hearts these
are not what the people want. What they want is a
life that is fuller, more beautiful, more splendid and,
above all, more human. And nobody can prepare it
and hand it over to them. They must get it themselves;
it must come up through them and out of
them, through long and toilsome processes of development;
for such is democracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man&#8217;s program will take a thousand
years!&#8221; Lincoln Steffens had said in despair that
day I introduced him to Jones. Yes&mdash;or a hundred
thousand. But there is no other way.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXXV</h2>
</div>


<p>The most efficient executive of which there is any
record in history is clearly that little centurion
who could say: &#8220;For I also am a man set under
authority, having under me soldiers; and I say unto
one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and
he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In my experience as an executive I learned that
it was easy to say &#8220;Go,&#8221; but that the fellows did not
go promptly; I could say &#8220;Come,&#8221; and he came&mdash;after
a while, perhaps, when I had said &#8220;Come&#8221;
again, and that sometimes, having said &#8220;Do this,&#8221; I
had to go myself and do it, or leave it undone.</p>

<p>Executive ability is a mysterious quality inhering
in personality, and partaking of its mysteries.</p>

<p>I had gone into the mayor&#8217;s office feeling that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
was about the most ill-prepared man for such a job
in the town. Naturally I had turned to Tom Johnson,
who had a tremendous reputation as an executive;
even his worst enemy, as the saying is, would
not deny his wonderful executive ability. I went
to him in a sort of despair, and he laughed and
leaned over and whispered&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But perhaps after all I should not tell. It was
spoken in confidence. And it is ungenerous and unkind
to destroy the cherished illusions of the world,
almost as unkind, I was about to say, as it is difficult,
since there is nothing the world so cherishes
and hugs to its sad old withered bosom as it does
its illusions. It may be that they are entirely necessary
to it, it may be that it could not get along
without them. What would this nation have done,
after all, if it had not been for executive ability and
the judicial temperament? The judicial temperament
consists, of course, in nothing more than the
calm assurance which enables one to put off till to-morrow
problems that should be decided to-day, for
if allowed to go long enough problems will solve
themselves, just as letters unanswered long enough
despatch their own replies.</p>

<p>I had deduced that generalization for myself
long ago, while waiting for judges to hand down
opinions, and then in decisions reading the well-known
formula: &#8220;The court does not find it necessary
to pass on this particular point at this time.&#8221;
Why, I applied one time to the Supreme Court, on
a Wednesday morning, for a stay of execution on
behalf of a man who was to be burned alive in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
electric chair on the following Friday, and the judicial
temperament who at that time happened to
be chief justice calmly said that the application
would be taken under advisement and a decision
handed down in due course, which, at the earliest,
was the following Tuesday morning. But the governor
half an hour afterward said, &#8220;Oh, well, don&#8217;t
worry; if the court doesn&#8217;t act, I&#8217;ll reprieve him,&#8221;
an example, perhaps, of what I had in mind when
I was writing those vague thoughts about making
government human. But executive ability! I had,
and still have, great admiration and reverence for
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Tom Johnson leaned over that afternoon, as
we sat there in the committee room of the House
at Columbus, and laughed and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the simplest thing in the world; decide every
question quickly and be right half the time. And
get somebody who can do the work. That&#8217;s all
there is to executive ability.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him in amazement. He had grown
quite serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another thing,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Don&#8217;t spend
too much time in your office. A quarter of an hour
each day is generally too long, unless there are a
whole lot of letters. Of course,&#8221; he went on reflectively,
&#8220;you can get clerks who can sign your name
better than you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first thing was to get men who could do the
work, a difficulty made greater because we have been
accustomed to bestow public offices as rewards for political
service; the office is for the man, not the man
for the office. I had a friend, a young man, who had
never been in politics in his life, though he had been
born and reared in Ohio. He was of an old, wealthy
and aristocratic family, a graduate of an eastern
university. His name was Franklin Macomber. I
appointed him a member of the Board of Public
Safety&mdash;we still had the board plan of government
then&mdash;and the appointment to office of a young aristocrat
afforded the newspapers and cartoonists an
opportunity for ridicule which they did not overlook.
But I knew the boy. I had seen him play football,
for one thing, and I knew how he managed his
own business. The vigor and the nerve he had displayed
on the football field at once showed in his
duties, and the ability and devotion he displayed in
his own affairs he applied in the public service. The
criticism to which the administration was constantly
subjected distressed him; he heard so much of it at
the fashionable club where he had his luncheons. One
afternoon he came into City Hall with an expression
more somber than usual, and as he sat down in my
office he began:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are saying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are saying?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people,&#8221; he replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>He had come, of course, from his luncheon at the
club. His motor car was at the door of the city
hall, and I asked him to take me for a drive, and
I suggested certain parts of town through which,
for a change, we might go. We ignored the avenues
and the boulevards, and for two hours drove about
through quiet streets far from the life of the town
as we knew it and as all men down in the business
section knew it&mdash;the old third ward, where the Poles
lived, and around to the upper end of the old seventh
where the shops and factories were, and then on over
through the eighth and the ninth, and so up to the
Hill, and after we had passed by all those blocks and
blocks of humble little homes, cottages of one story,
and all that, I asked him if he knew what the folk who
lived in them were saying about the administration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I never talk with any
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I ventured to say, &#8220;they are the people,
they who live in those little houses with the low
roofs. It is important to know how they feel, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>I always felt that he had a new vision after that;
he saw that if government was to mean anything
to these persons, it must be made human, and the
reforms in the police and fire departments he
wrought out in that spirit were such that when he
died, in not quite four years, when he was just
turned thirty, the cartoonist had long since ceased
to caricature him as an idle fop, and the newspaper
editorials mourned him, in common with most of the
community, as one of the best public servants our
city, or any city, ever had.</p>

<p>I went into the mayor&#8217;s office, as I said, all unprepared.
My equipment was what the observations
of a political reporter, a young lawyer&#8217;s participation
in the politics of his state, and an intimacy with
Golden Rule Jones could make it. It was not much,
though it was as much perhaps as have most men
who become municipal officials in our land, where
in all branches of the civil service, training and experience,
when they are considered at all, seem to be
the last requisites. The condition I suppose is implicit
in democracy, which has the defects of its
own virtues, and founds its institutions in distrust.
They order these things better in Germany, by committing
the administration of municipal affairs to
trained men as to a learned profession, though the
German cities have the disadvantage of having so reformed
their civil service that it is a monstrous bureaucracy.
I had been chosen chiefly because I had
been the friend of my distinguished predecessor, and
for a long time I was so inveterately referred to as of
that honored relation, so invariably introduced as
the successor of Golden Rule Jones, that I was
haunted by the disquieting dread that I was expected
to be, if not a replica of him, at least some
sort of measurable imitation of his manners and
methods, the most impossible achievement in the
world, since his was a personality wholly original
and unique. And then besides, a man prefers to
be himself. But of all those, and they were many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and respectable, who doubted my ability, there was
none whose distrust could exceed my own. I knew
one thing, at any rate, and that was, that I did not
know.</p>

<p>Aside from my political principles, which I presume
may as well be called liberal, and certain theories
which were called radical, though even then I
knew enough of human nature to know that they
could not be realized, especially in one small city
in the American Middle West, I had been able to
make, or at least to recognize when others made
them, as Mr. Bryce and most of the students of municipal
government in America had done, two or
three generalizations which, upon the whole, after
four terms in a mayor&#8217;s office testing them, I still believe
to be sound. The first was that, whatever the
mere form of local government, our cities were directly
ruled by those small coteries we had come to
call political machines; the second, that these machines
ruled the cities for the benefit of public utility
corporations; and the third, that the legal power
through which this was accomplished was derived
from legislatures controlled by the same persons in
the same interest. That is, the people had no voice
in their own affairs; representative government itself
had disappeared. Therefore these remedies
seemed to be indicated, as the doctors say&mdash;non-partizan
city elections, municipal ownership, and
home rule for cities. This was the task, this was
the program.</p>

<p>We had already defeated the machines; Jones had
made that victory possible by his great pioneer work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
in destroying the superstition of party regularity.
I say defeated the machines, when perhaps I should
say checked the machines, since the bosses remained
and the partizans who made them possible. And the
public utilities were in private hands, the street railway
company still was there, desperate because its
franchises were about to expire, and its securities,
through the financiering too familiar to America in
these latter days, six times the amount of its actual
investment. And down at Columbus, the legislature
still was sitting, controlled by rural members
who knew nothing of cities or of city life or city
problems, farmers and country lawyers and the politicians
of small towns, who, in the historic opposition
of the ruralite to the urbanite, could not
only favor their party confreres and conspirators
from the city&mdash;machine politicians to whom they
turned for advice&mdash;but gain a cheap <i>r&eacute;clame</i> at home
by opposing every measure designed to set the cities
free. Thus the bosses in both parties, the machine
politicians, the corporations, and their lawyers, promoters,
lobbyists, kept editors, ward heelers, office
holders, spies, and parasites of every kind were lying
in wait on every hand. And besides, though inspired
by other motives, the &#8220;good&#8221; people were always
insisting on the &#8220;moral&#8221; issue; urging us to
turn aside from our larger immediate purpose, and
concentrate our official attention on the &#8220;bad&#8221; people&mdash;and
wreck our movement. Our immediate purpose
was to defeat the effort of the street railway
company to obtain a franchise, to prevent it from
performing the miracle of transmuting twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
millions in green paper into twenty-five millions in
gold, and thereby absorb the commercial values of
half a century. To do this it was necessary to win
elections for years, and to win elections, one must
have votes, and &#8220;bad&#8221; people have votes, equally
with &#8220;good&#8221; people, and if one is to judge from
the comment of the &#8220;good&#8221; people on the election returns,
the &#8220;bad&#8221; people in most cities are in the majority.
On that point, I believe, the reformers and
the politicians at least are agreed. More than this,
we had to obtain from reluctant legislatures the powers
that would put the city at least on equal terms
with the corporations which had always proved so
much more potent than the city. Such was the
struggle our movement faced, such was the victory to
be won before our city could be free from the triumvirate
that so long had exploited it, the political
boss, the franchise promoter, and the country politician.
The Free City! That was the noble dream.</p>

<p>Well might the wise and sophisticated laugh at
their mayor and call him dreamer! It was, and,
alas, it is a dream. But youth is so sublimely confident,
and counts so little on opposition. Not the
opposition of those who array themselves against
it&mdash;that was to be expected, of course, that was
part of the glorious conflict&mdash;but the opposition
from within the ranks, the opposition on the hither
side of the barricade. For youth thinks, sometimes,
that even opponents may be won, if only they can
be brought to that vantage ground whence one inevitably
beholds the fair and radiant vision. It had
not expected the falling away of followers, of supporters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
even of friends&mdash;the strangely averted eye
on the street, the suddenly abandoned weekly call,
the cessation of little notes of encouragement, the
amazing revelations of malignity and bitterness at
election times, and the flood increasing in volume at
each succeeding election. One man, thought to be
devoted to a cause, fails in his desire to secure an
office; another you refuse a contract; he whom you
neglected to favor in January punctually appears in
the opposition ranks in November, one by one they
drop away, and multiply into an army. Even in the
official group in the City Hall and in the council,
there are jealousies, and childish spites, and pitiable
little ambitions and with them misunderstanding,
gossip, slander, anonymous attacks, lies, abuse,
hatred, until youth makes the awful discovery that
there is, after all, in human nature, pure malice,
and youth must fight hard to retain its ideals, so
continually are all the old lovely illusions stripped
away in this bewildering complication of little tragedies
and comedies we call life.</p>

<p>To be sure, youth might have known, having read
the like in books from infancy, and having made
some reflections of its own on the irony of things,
and indulged from time to time in philosophizings.
But that was about the experience of others, from
which none of us is wise enough to learn. Most of
us indeed are not wise enough to learn from our
own. It is all a part of life. What a thing human
life is, to be sure, and human nature! <i>Ay di mi!</i>
as Carlyle used to say. Patience, and shuffle the
cards!...</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>... I had no intention of recalling such things.
Did not Jones say that when the Golden Rule would
not work, it was not the fault of the Rule, but because
one did not quite know how to work it? I have
no intention of setting down the failures or the little
successes of four terms as mayor. Nor shall I write
a little history of those terms in office; I could not,
and it would not be worth while if I could. I shall
not attempt in these pages a treatise on municipal
government, for if the task were rightly executed,
it would be a history of civilization. Non-partizanship
in municipal elections, municipal ownership,
home rule for cities,&mdash;who is interested in these? I
have discussed them in interviews&mdash;(&#8220;Is there to be a
statement for us this morning, Mr. Mayor?&#8221;)&mdash;and
speeches numerous as autumn leaves, and like them,
lost now in the winds to which they were given.</p>

<p>After all, it is life in which we are all interested.
And one sees a deal of life in a mayor&#8217;s office, and in
it one may learn to envisage it as&mdash;just life. Then
one can have a philosophy about it, though one cannot
discover a panacea, some sort of sociological
patent medicine to be administered to the community,
like Socialism, or Prohibition, or absolute law
enforcement, or the commission form of government.
One indeed may open one&#8217;s eyes and look at one&#8217;s
city and presently behold its vast antitheses, its
boulevards and marble palaces at one end, and its
slums, its tenements and tenderloins at the other.
He may discern there the operations of universal
and inexorable laws, and realize the tremendous conflict
that everywhere and in all times goes on between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
privilege and the people. Such a view may
simplify life for him; it may make easy the peroration
to the campaign speech; it may provide a glib
and facile answer to any question. But he should
have a care lest it make him the slave of its own
<i>clich&eacute;s</i>, as Socialists for instance, when they become
purely scientific, explain every human impulse, emotion
and deed by simply repeating the formula
&#8220;Economic determinism.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it will not do; it will not suffice. This view
of life is simple only because it is narrow and confined;
in far perspectives there appear curious and
perplexing contradictions. And even then, the most
exhaustive analysis of life and of human society,
however immense and comprehensive, however logical
and inevitable its generalizations, must always
fall short simply because no human mind and no
assembly of human minds can ever wholly envisage
the vast and bewildering complexity of human life.
Each man views life from that angle where he happens
to have been placed by forces he cannot comprehend.
All of which no doubt is a mere repetition
in feebler terms of what has heretofore been spoken
of the inherent vice of the sectarian mind. There
are no rigid distinctions of good and bad, of proletarians
and capitalists, of privileged and proscribed;
there are just people, just folks, as Jones
said, with their human weaknesses, follies, and mistakes,
their petty ambitions, their miserable jealousies
and envies, their triumphs, and glories and
boundless dreams, and all tending somewhither, they
know not where nor how, and all pretty much alike.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
And government, be its form what it may, is but
the reflection of all these qualities. The city, said
Coriolanus, is the people, and as Jones used to say,
with those strange embracing gestures, &#8220;I believe in
<i>all</i> the people.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>


<p>However, all these confused elements make the
task of a mayor exceedingly difficult, especially in
America where there are, not so many kinds of
people, but so many different standards and customs
and habits. When one gets down into humanity,
one beholds not two classes, separate and distinct
as the sexes, but innumerable classes. In Toledo
something more than twenty languages and dialects
are spoken every day, and as the mayor is addressed
the chorus becomes a very babel, a confusion of
tongues, all counseling him to his duty. The result
is apt to be perplexing at times. The rights
of &#8220;business&#8221; in the streets and to the public property,
the proper bounds within which strikers and
strike breakers are to be confined, the limitations
of the activities of pickets, the hours in which it is
proper to drink beer, who in the community should
gamble, whether Irishmen or Germans make the
better policemen; the exact proportion of public
jobs which Poles and Hungarians should hold;
whether Socialists on their soap boxes are obstructing
traffic or merely exercising the constitutional
right of free speech, whether there are more Catholics
than Protestants holding office; whether the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
East Side is receiving its due consideration in comparison
with the West Side; whether boys have the
right to play ball in the streets, and lovers to spoon
in parks, and whose conceptions of morals is to prevail&mdash;these,
like the sins of the Psalmist, are ever
before him.</p>

<p>And with it all there is a strange, inexplicable
belief in the almost supernatural power of a mayor.
I have been waited on by committees&mdash;of aged men&mdash;demanding
that I stop at once those lovers who
sought the public park on moonlit nights in June,
I have been roused from bed at two o&#8217;clock in the
morning, with a demand that a team of horses in
a barn four miles on the other side of town be fed;
innumerable ladies have appealed to me to compel
their husbands to show them more affectionate attention,
others have asked me to prohibit their
neighbors from talking about them. One Jewish
resident was so devout that he emigrated to Jerusalem,
and his family insisted that I recall him; a
Christian missionary asked me to detail policemen to
assist him in converting the Jews to his creed; and
pathetic mothers were ever imploring me to order
the release of their sons and husbands from prisons
and penitentiaries, over which I had no possible
jurisdiction. I have recalled I know not how many
times a remark Jones made one evening after one
of those weary days I afterward came to know so
well; &#8220;I could wash my hands every day in women&#8217;s
tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, the main thing was not to wash one&#8217;s
hands of them or their difficulties. I remember one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
poor soul whose husband was in the penitentiary.
She came to me in a despair that was almost frantic,
and showed me a letter she had received from
her husband. A new governor had been elected in
that state wherein he was imprisoned, and he urged
his wife, in the letter she gave me to read, to secure
a pardon for him before the new governor was inaugurated.
&#8220;They say,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;that the new
governor is a good church member, which is a bad
sign for being good to prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor soul! It was impossible to explain to her
that I was wholly powerless. She stood and humbly
shook her sorrowful head, and to each new attempt
at explanation she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the father of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a phrase which most of the women of the
foreign born population employed; they repeated
it as though it were some charmed formula. This
exaggerated notion of the mayoral power was not
confined to those citizens of the foreign quarters;
it was shared by many of the native Americans, who
held the mayor responsible for all the vices of the
community, and I was never more sharply criticized
than when, in refusing to sanction the enactment of
a curfew ordinance, I tentatively advanced the suggestion
that, if it did not seem too outrageously
radical, the rearing and training of children was
the duty, not so much of the police as of parents,
pastors and teachers.</p>

<p>It may have been because, in some way, it had got
abroad that I was a reformer myself. It was at a
time when there was new and searching inquiry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
a new sense of public decency, the result of a profound
impulse in the public consciousness, and I
had been of those who in my town had opposed the
political machines. Constructive thinking and constructive
work being the hardest task in the world,
one of which our democracy in its present development
is not yet fully capable, the impulse spent itself
largely in destructive work. That was natural; it
is a quality inherent in humanity. My friend Kermode
F. Gill, the artist-builder and contractor of
Cleveland, once told me that while it is difficult to
get men to carry on any large construction, and
carry it on well, and necessary to set task masters
over them to have the work done at all, there is
a wholly different spirit in evidence when the work
is one of demolition. If a great building is to
be torn down, the men need no task masters, no
speeding up, they fly at it in a perfect frenzy, with
a veritable passion, and tear it down so swiftly that
the one difficulty is to get the salvage. And in
the course of building public works I have observed
the same phenomenon. While the forces are tearing
down, while they are excavating, that black
fringe of spectators, the &#8220;crow line&#8221; the builders
call it, is always there. But when once the work
is above ground, and construction begins, when the
structure lifts itself, when it aspires,&mdash;the crow
line dissolves and melts quite away. This, in a sense,
is true of man in any of his operations. When the
great awakening came, after the first shock of surprise,
after the first resolve to do better, the public
went at the work of demolition, all about the arena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the thumbs of the multitude were turned down, and
we witnessed the tragedy of men who but a short
while before had been praised and lauded for their
possessions, and used as models for little boys in
Sunday-school, suddenly stripped of all their coveted
garments, and held up to the hatred and ridicule
of a world that can yet think of nothing better
than the stocks, the pillory, the jail, and the scaffold.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh I was shown a little church of
which Sir Walter Scott was once a vestryman, or
deacon or elder or some such official, and in the door
still hung the irons in which offenders were fastened
on Sunday mornings so that the righteous, as they
went to pray, might comfort themselves with a consoling
sense of their own goodness by spitting in
the face of the sinner. Many of our reforms are
still carried on in this spirit, and are no more sensible
or productive of good.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;reformer,&#8221; like the word &#8220;politician&#8221;
has degenerated, and, in the mind of the common
man, come to connote something very disagreeable.
In four terms as mayor I came to know both species
pretty well, and, in the later connotations of the
term, I prefer the politician. He, at least, is human.
The reformers, as Emerson said, affect one
as the insane do; their motives may be pious, but
their methods are profane. They are a buzz in the
ear.</p>

<p>I had read this in Emerson in my youth, when for
a long time I had a veritable passion for him, just
as in a former stage, and another mood, I had had
a veritable passion for books about Napoleon, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
at another, for the works of Carlyle, and the controversy
excited by the reckless Froude; but the truth&mdash;as
it appears to me, or at any rate, the part of
a truth&mdash;was not borne in upon me until I came
to know and to regard, with dread, the possibility
that I might be included in their number, which I
should not like, unless it were as a mere brother in
humanity, somewhat estranged in spirit though we
should be.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIX</h2>
</div>


<p>The disadvantages of being classed as a reformer
are not, I am sure, sufficiently appreciated; if they
were the peace of the world would not be troubled
as constantly as it is by those who would make mankind
over on a model of which they present themselves
as the unattractive example. One of those
advantages is that each reformer thinks that all the
other reformers are in honor committed to his reform;
he writes them letters asking for expressions
of sympathy and support, and, generally, when he
finds that each of the others has some darling reform
of his own which he is determined to try on an
unwilling public, he is at once denounced as a traitor
to the whole scheme of reform in the universe. Another
disadvantage is that reformers never are re&euml;lected,
and I might set forth others, were it my
intention to embark on that interesting subject.</p>

<p>I am moved to these observations, however, by the
recollection of an experience, exasperating at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
time, though now of no moment, since it has cured
itself as will most exasperations if left long enough
to themselves. Its importance, if it have any importance
at all, may be ascribed to its effect of having
saved me from any such fatal classification,
unless I were far enough away from home, where
almost anyone may be regarded as a reformer. To
be sure, as I was just saying, in the days immediately
following my first election, I was regarded by
many of the sacred and illuminated host of reformers
in the land as one of them, since I was asked to
join in all sorts of movements for all sorts of prohibitions,&mdash;of
the use of intoxicating liquors and
tobacco and cigarettes, and I know not what other
vices abhorred by those who are not addicted to
them,&mdash;but it was my good luck, as it seems now to
have been, to be saved from that fate by as good
and faithful an enemy as ever helped a politician
along. The Democrats had been placed in power
that year in Ohio, and with Tom Johnson, many of
us felt that it was an opportunity to secure certain
changes in the laws of Ohio relating to the
government of cities, that is, we felt it was time
to secure our own reforms; everyone else, of course,
felt the same way about his reforms. We had organized
late in the previous year an association of
the mayors of the cities in the state for the purpose
of making changes in the municipal code that
would give the cities a more mobile form of government
and greater powers, in other words, it was
the first definite movement in favor of home rule for
cities, a liberation for which we struggled for almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
a decade before we achieved any measure of
success. We had drafted a new municipal code
and had met at Columbus early in that January in
which I took my office, to put the finishing touches
to our code before presenting it to the legislature,
and one morning I strolled into the hall of the House
of Representatives before the daily session had been
convened.</p>

<p>There was in the House at that time a newly
elected member whom Johnson had supported for
election and no sooner was he in his seat than he
opposed every measure Johnson espoused, and,
under the warming applause his disloyalty won from
Johnson&#8217;s enemies, he became an opponent of the
mayor more vociferous than effective. He was exactly,
I think, of that type described by Emerson,
who in the course of saying everything worth saying,
or that will be worth saying for the next two
hundred years, said: &#8220;Republics abound in young
civilians who believe that the laws make the city,
that grave modifications of the policy and modes of
living and employments of the population, that commerce,
education and religion, may be voted in or
out; and that any measure, though it were absurd,
may be imposed on a people if only you can get sufficient
voices to make it a law. But the wise know
that foolish legislation is a rope of sand which perishes
in the twisting; that the state must follow and
not lead the character and progress of the citizen;
the strongest usurper is quickly got rid of; and they
only who build on Ideas build for eternity; and that
the form of government which prevails is the expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
of what cultivation exists in the population
which permits it. The law is only a memorandum.
We are superstitious, and esteem the statute somewhat;
so much life as it has in the character of living
men is its force.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew this young civilian then only as one of the
Johnson group and as that was sufficient introduction,
in the <i>camaraderie</i> that existed between those of
us who were devoted to the same cause, I stopped, at
his salutation, and chatted with him for a moment.
He had asked my opinion on a bill he had introduced,
a measure to prohibit or regulate public
dances in cities, or some such thing, and when I
failed to evince the due degree of interest in the
young man&#8217;s measure, he was at once displeased and
tried to heat me to the proper degree of warmth in
the holy cause of reform. He began, of course, by
an indignant demand to know if I was in favor of
the evils that were connected with public dances, and
when I tried to show him that my inability to recognize
his measure as the only adequate method of
dealing with those evils did not necessarily indicate
approval of them, he struck the prescribed attitude,
held up his right hand and said something in
the melodramatic style, about the oath of office I
had taken not many days before. I saw at once
then that I was dealing with a member in high
standing of the order of the indurated sectarian
mind, whose fanaticism makes them the most impossible
persons in the world, and having never been
certain which of the advice in the Proverbs should
be accepted, I yielded to a fatal habit of joking&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
history of the Republic is strewn with the wrecks
of careers that were broken by a jest&mdash;and told him
that I had taken my oath of office before a notary
public, and that perhaps it had not been of full efficacy
on that account.</p>

<p>And then I went away, and forgot the incident.
It was revived in my memory, however, and intensified
in its interest for me the next morning, when
on getting back home, I saw in the newspapers a
despatch from Columbus, under the most ominous
of black headlines, stating that I had told the distinguished
representative, on the very floor of the
House, under the aegis, one almost might say, of
the state, that I had no reverence for my oath of office,
and did not intend to respect it. Here was
anarchy for you, indeed, from the old pupil of Altgeld!</p>

<p>It was, of course, useless to explain, since any
statement I might make would be but one more welcome
knot to the tangle of misrepresentation in
which the unhappy incident was being so gladly
snarled, and I tried to forget it, though that was
impossible, since it provided the text for many a
sanctimonious editorial in the land, in each one of
which some addition was made to the original report.
Herbert Spencer says somewhere that for
every story told in the world there is some basis of
truth, and I suppose he is right, but I have always
felt that he did not, at least in my reading of him,
sufficiently characterize that worst vice of the human
mind, intellectual dishonesty. Perhaps if he had associated
less with scientists and more with professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
reformers of the morals of other persons he
would not have omitted this curious specimen from
his philosophic analysis, if he did omit it; and if that
experience of the young civilian at Columbus had
not been sufficient, I could have supplied him with
another out of an episode in which I had borne a
part some years before, one which should have been
sufficient to warn me against the type for the rest
of my life.</p>

<p>It concerns another young civilian, though this
one was so old that he should have known better,
and relates to a time years before when I happened
to be running for the state senate. I say happened,
for it was precisely of that fortuitous nature, since
I had not been concerned in the circumstances which
nominated me, so entirely negative in their character
that I might as well have been said not to be running
at all. I was a young lawyer, just beginning
to practice, and in my wide leisure was out of town
that summer, economically spending a holiday at
my father&#8217;s house, and, since the Democrats had no
hope in this world of carrying the district, and
could get no one who was on the ground to defend
himself to accept their nomination, they had nominated
me. It was an honor, perhaps, but so empty
and futile that when I came home again it seemed
useless even to decline it, and best to forget it, and
so I tried to do that, and made no campaign at all.
But one afternoon I had a caller, a tall, dark
visaged man, in black clerical garb, who came softly
into my office, carefully closed the door, and, fixing
his strange, intense eyes on me, said that he came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
talk politics. He represented a reform league and
he came, he said, to discuss my candidature for the
state senate, and to offer me the support of his organization.
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he went on to explain, &#8220;we
should impose certain conditions.&#8221; He fixed on me
again and very intently, those strange, fanatic eyes.</p>

<p>I knew very well what the conditions were; it was
hardly necessary for him to explain that I should be
expected to sign a pledge to support the bills proposed
by his organization, some of which, no doubt,
were excellent measures.</p>

<p>I explained to him that I was under no illusions
as to the campaign, that there was no possible chance
of my election that year, that if there had been I
never would have been nominated, and nothing short
of a miracle could elect me. &#8220;But,&#8221; I added, &#8220;even
if that miracle happens, though it will not, and I
should be elected, I should go down to Columbus and
to the Senate able to say that I had made no promises
whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment, with those strange,
cold eyes peering narrowly out of his somber visage,
and as he gazed they seemed to contract, and with
the faint shadow of a smile that was wholly without
humor, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>The smile raised the man&#8217;s cheeks a little higher
until they enclosed the little eyes in minute wrinkles,
and invested them with an expression of the deepest
cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, since you are opposed to signing our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
pledge, we will waive that in your case, and you and
I can have a little private understanding&mdash;no one
need ever know, and you can say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he was gently
tapping the ends of his fingers together, and the last
terms of his proposal seemed to be absorbed by an
expression of vulpine significance so eloquent and
plain in its meaning that mere words were superfluous.</p>

<p>I sat there and looked at him; I had known of him,
he spoke nearly every Sunday in some church, and
took up collections for the reform to which, quite
sincerely, I believe, he was devoting his life. Then
I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t my idea even of politics, to say
nothing of ethics.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe now that he had no conception of the
moral significance of his suggestion that we have
an implied understanding which I was to be at liberty
to deny if the exigencies of politics suggested
it. He was a reformer, belonging to the order of
the indurated mind. He was possessed by a theory,
which held his mind in the relentless mould of its
absolutism, and there his mind had hardened, and,
alas, his heart, too, no doubt&mdash;so that its original
impressions were all fixed and immutable, and not
subject to change; they could not be erased nor
could any new impressions be superimposed. He was
convinced that his particular theory was correct,
and that if only it could be imposed on mankind, the
world would be infinitely better off; and that hence
any means, no matter what, were permissible in effecting
this imposition, because of the good that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
would follow. It is an old mental attitude in this
world, well treated of in books, and understood and
recognized by everyone except those who adopt it,
and in its spirit every new reform is promulgated by
its avatar. But the reformer never thinks of himself
in any such light, of course, he does not understand
it any more than he understands mankind&#8217;s
distrust of him. It is the instinctive fear of the
theorist that has been felt for every one of them from
Robespierre, the archtype, and impossibilist par excellence,
down to the latest man haranguing his little
idle crowd on the street corner.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XL</h2>
</div>


<p>These observations come with the recollection of
those days of my first term in the mayor&#8217;s office
when I had so much to do with reformers that I
earnestly desired that no one would ever include me
in their category. They came to see me so often
and in such numbers that my whole view of life was
quite in danger of distortion. It seemed that half
the populace had set forth in a rage to reform mankind,
and their first need was to get the mayor to use
the police force to help them. When they did not
call at the office, they were writing letters. The
favorite day for these expressions of the reforming
spirit was Monday. I had been many months in the
office however, before I was able to make this generalization,
though from the first I could observe
that Monday took on something of that dismal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
somber tone which has given it its name of blue
Monday. In the early days of a simpler life in our
country, when the customs of the pioneer had not
been superseded by the complexities of modern existence,
its color used to be ascribed to the fact that it
was wash day, and perhaps it has remained a sort of
moral wash day ever since. At any rate we soon
discovered that everyone who had a grievance or a
complaint or a suggestion about his neighbor or
some larger scheme of reforming whole groups of the
population was most likely to be heavily charged
with it on Monday, and since the almost universal
conception among us is that all reforms can be
wrought by the mayor, by the simple process of
issuing an order to the police, these complaints
were of course lodged at the mayor&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>They were of a curious variety, expressing, I suppose,
not only all the moral yearnings of mankind,
but all the meaner moods of human nature, and each
new Monday morning seemed to have in reserve, for
a nature that was trying to keep its faith in humanity,
some fresh and theretofore unimagined instance
of the depths of little meannesses to which human
nature is capable of sinking. Many of them came
in person with their criticism, others sent anonymous
letters. Then there were those who came to
repeat ugly things they had heard about me; &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t tell you this if I were not your friend. I
think you ought to know it.&#8221; Later in the afternoon
the evenings&#8217; newspapers, with the criticisms marked,
were laid on my desk. All this made Monday the
hardest day of the week, especially as the day closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
with the hebdominal session of the council, where one
might find now and then some pretty discouraging
examples of human meanness. Tuesday was not
quite so bad, though it was trying; human nature
seemed to run pretty high, or pretty low, on that
day, too. By Wednesday, the atmosphere began to
clear, and by Thursday and Friday, everyone seemed
to be attending to his own business and letting the
faults of his neighbors go unnoted or at least unreported,
and Saturday was a day of such calm that
one&#8217;s whole faith in humanity was miraculously restored;
if the weather was fine one might almost discover
human nature as to be good as that nature
which would reveal herself on the golf links.</p>

<p>As a result of it all we finally made the deduction&mdash;my
secretary Bernard Dailey, the stenographers
in the office and the reporters who formed so pleasant
an element of the life there&mdash;that it was all due to
the effects of the Sunday that had intervened. In
the first place, people had leisure on that day and
in that leisure they could whet up their consciences
and set them to the congenial task of dissecting the
characters of other people, or they could contemplate
the evils in the world and resolve highly to
make the mayor do away with them, and then after
the custom of our land they could gorge on the
huge Sunday noon dinner of roast beef, and then lie
about all afternoon like pythons in a torpor which
produced an indigestion so acute and lasting that
for three days it passed very well for pious fervor
and zeal for reform. Such at least was our theory,
offered here solely in the scientific spirit, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
by any means as final. It was acquiesced in by all
of us at the time, and has been supported by an unvarying
series of data on the Monday mornings
since then.</p>

<p>We submitted it to Henry Frisch, the police sergeant
who had been detailed for duty in the mayor&#8217;s
office for many years, a dear and comfortable soul,
who had served under several mayors, and had developed
a philosophy of life that was a very Nirvana
of comfort and repose. Long ago, so it
seemed when he smiled indulgently on the discomfiture
of blue Monday, he had given up humanity as
a bad job; to him the race was utterly and irredeemably
hopeless, and without the need of saying a
word he could shake his honest head at the suggestion
of a new reform with a motion that was eloquent
of all negation. He was very tolerant, however,
and made no argument in rebuttal, he simply
refused to accept humanity on any general plane;
regarding the race as a biological species merely,
he would confide to you that his years of experience
at that post and as a policeman who had paced his
beat and afterward commanded a sergeant&#8217;s squad,
had convinced him that it was altogether depraved,
dishonest and disgusting, but with any individual
specimen of the species he was not that way at all.
He was really kindness itself. The next minute, with
tears in his eyes, he would go to any extremes to
help some poor devil out of trouble. Unless it were
reformers; for these he had no use, he said, and if his
advice had been accepted he would have been permitted
to expel them from the City Hall by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
own beloved weapons of violence and force of arms.
On Sundays he went fishing.</p>

<p>Perhaps at the time of which I am thinking, if
not very specifically writing, there was more of this
Monday spirit of reform than is usual. In the first
place, much is expected of a new official and because
he does not promptly work those miracles which are
confidently expected whether he was foolish enough
to promise them or not, he is so generally complained
of that it may be set down as an axiom of practical
politics that any elected official, in the executive
branch of the government, could be recalled at
any time during the first year of his incumbency
of his office. Just then, too, there had been elected
to the governorship a gentleman who had been very
deeply devoted to the interests of the Methodist
Church, the strongest denomination numerically in
Ohio&mdash;the first governor of Ohio, indeed, was a
Methodist preacher&mdash;and because of that fact and
because of the use in his inaugural message of the
magic phrase &#8220;law and order,&#8221; it was at once announced
in the most sensational manner of the sensational
press that, unless all the sumptuary laws in
Ohio were drastically enforced, all the mayors of the
cities would be removed. Governor Pattison had
been elected as a Democrat, and during his campaign
Tom Johnson and I had supported him, and it was
while we were in Columbus at his inauguration that
this sensation was exploited in the newspapers. I
remember how Tom Johnson received it when one
of his coterie brought the extra editions into the
hotel and pointed out to him the dreadful predictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
of the headlines; the white, aristocratic hand waved
the suggestion imperiously aside, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Four days, and it&#8217;ll all be over. That&#8217;s the life
of a newspaper sensation.&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe that newspaper editors themselves place
the limit of the effectiveness of a sensation at about
that time, though some of them are so shrewd that
they drop the sensation the day before the people
begin to lose interest in it, instead of waiting for
the day on which they actually tire of it. Which
may be an explanation of the fact that the beginnings
of things are always treated so much more
fully in the press than their endings; one always
reads of the opening of the trial, and the awful
charge, but is never told how it all came out in the
end, unless the end was catastrophic. The theory of
the press is, I believe, that good news is no news.</p>

<p>I do not know that poor Governor Pattison ever
had any intention of raising the issue of local self-government,
and of raising it in such a direct and
positive way as by attempting to remove all the
mayors of Ohio towns and cities in which it could be
shown that some little enactment of the legislature
had failed of absolute enforcement; I suppose he had
no such intention, since the law gave him no such
power, though that made no difference to the professional
reverencers and enforcers of law. The poor
man never saw the governor&#8217;s office after that night
of his brilliant inauguration, when he stood, very
dark and weary, with features drawn, but resolutely
smiling, at his levee in the senate chamber, a tragic
figure in a way, the first Democratic governor in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
long while, and the fates treating him with their customary
irony and indignity by setting their seal
upon him in the very hour of his triumph. He died
in a few months, but there remained many of course
who could prophesy in his name and cast out devils
with each extra edition of the newspapers, and the
discussion of law enforcement has gone on pretty
steadily from that time to this.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XLI</h2>
</div>


<p>I suppose the discussion is one which must go on
always in any land where the people of our race
and tradition dwell. A more objective, natural and
na&iuml;ve people would not be so interested in sin, and
when the late Mayor Gaynor of New York spoke of
the difficulty of administering the affairs of a modern
city according to &#8220;the standard of exquisite morals&#8221;
held aloft by some persons for others, he designated
in his clear and clever way a class of citizens familiar
to every mayor by the curiously doctrinaire order
of indurated mind with which they are endowed.
They begin with the na&iuml;ve assumption that their
standard is the one and only correct standard, and
that since men have repeatedly refused to adopt it
on mere inspection they must be forced to do so by
the use of violence, a process which they call maintaining
&#8220;law and order.&#8221; They believe that any
wrong, any abuse, may be stopped instantly by the
passage of a law, and if one venture to question the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
efficacy of any plan they propose, he is said at once
to be opposed to morality and to religion, and is set
down as a profane and sacrilegious person.</p>

<p>It is, of course, inconvenient to argue with a
person who has the supreme refuge of the irrelevant
conclusion; as inconvenient as it would be were one
to be offered carbolic acid as a toilet article,
and, upon refusal, be accused of not believing in
cleanliness. This order of mind imagines that every
phase of human conduct can be ordered and regulated
by the enactment of statutes; that the industries,
occupations, clothing, amusements, appetites,
passions, prejudices, opinions, ambitions, aspirations
and devotions of man can be changed, moulded and
regulated by city councils and state legislatures.
Every inconvenience, every difficulty, every disagreeable
feature of modern life, is to be done away by
the passage of a law.</p>

<p>That our race is saturated with this curious and
amazing superstition of the power of written enactments
is shown by the common terminology. The
mental reactions of a large portion of mankind
against the irritation of opposing opinion and conduct
habitually express themselves in the phrase,
&#8220;There ought to be a law.&#8221; It is heard as often
every day as the stereotyped references to the
weather. Not a disagreeable incident in life is complained
of without that expression; no one has a
pet aversion or a darling prejudice that he does not
cherish the desire of having a law passed to bring
the rest of the world around to his way of feeling.
And when a trust is formed, or a strike interrupts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
business, or the sheets on the hotel bed are too short,
or the hatpin of a woman in a crowded street car
is too long, or a new dance is introduced, or a boor
pre&euml;mpts a seat in a train, or a cat howls on the
back-yard fence in the night time, or a waiter is
impertinent, or the cook leaves, the indignant citizen
lifts his eyes hopefully toward that annual calamity
known as the session of the state legislature, and
repeats the formula: &#8220;There ought to be a law.&#8221;
And when the legislature assembles, a whole body of
foolish bills is introduced regulating everything in
the earth, and some things that are outside of the
earth. If a deed is disapproved of by a group of
people, an agitation is begun to make it a criminal
offense; by means of pains and penalties the whole of
life is to be regulated, and government is to
become a vast bureaucracy of policemen, catch-polls,
inspectors, beadles, censors, mentors, monitors
and spies. As the session draws toward its close,
the haste to enact all these measures becomes frantic.
I shall never forget those scenes of riot, the howling
and drunkenness and confusion and worse I have
witnessed in the legislatures of Illinois and of Ohio
the last night of the session. And all this delirium
goes on in every state of the Union, every winter&mdash;and
all these enactments must be revered. It is the
phase of the apotheosis of the policeman, who is to
replace nurse and parent and teacher and pastor,
and, relieving all these of their responsibilities, undertake
to remould man into a being of absolute perfection,
in whom character may be dispensed with,
since he is to dwell forever under the crystal dome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
of a moral vacuum from which temptation has been
scientifically exhausted.</p>

<p>The reason is simple, and obvious; it inheres in
the belief in the absolute. Your true reformer is
not only without humor, without pity, without
mercy, but he is without knowledge of life or of
human nature, and without very much of any sort
of sweetness and light. The more moral he is, the
harder he is, and the more amazingly ready with
cruel judgments; and he seldom smiles except with
the unction that comes with the thought of his own
moral superiority. He thinks there is an absolute
good and an absolute bad, and hence absolutely good
people and absolutely bad people.</p>

<p>The peculiar and distinguishing feature of his
mind is that life is presented to it in stark and rigid
outline. He is blandly unconscious of distinctions;
he has no perception of proportions, no knowledge
of values, in a word, no sense of humor. His world
is made up of wholly unrelated antitheses. There
are no shades or shadows, no gradations, no delicate
and subtle relativities. A thing is either black or
white, good or bad. A deed is either moral or immoral,
a virtue or a crime. It is all very simple.
All acts of which he does not himself approve are
evil; all who do not think and act as he thinks and
acts, are bad. If you do not know when a deed, or
an opinion is wrong, he will tell you; and if you
doubt him or differ with him, you are bad, and it
is time to call in the police. &#8220;Whenever the Commons
has nothing else to do,&#8221; said the wise old member
of Parliament, &#8220;it can always make a new crime.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Statutes are thus enacted, as the saying is, against
all evils, great and small, and the greater the evil,
of course, the greater the moral triumph expressed
by the mere enactment. But because of certain contrarieties
in nature and a certain obstreperous quality
in human nature and a general complexity in
life as a whole these legal fulminations are frequently
triumphs only in theory, and in practice often intensify
the very ills they seek to cure. As the witty
Remy de Gourmont says: <i>Quand la morale triomphe
il se passes des choses tr&egrave;s vilaines.</i></p>

<p>The more intensively developed specimen of the
type will not overtly sin himself, but he loves to inspect
those who do, and to peer at them, and to wonder
how they could ever have the courage to do it;
he likes to imagine their sensations, and to note each
one of them as it was developed in the interesting
experience. And hence the psychic lasciviousness of
those who are constantly reporting plays and pictures
as fit for the censor they are always clamoring
for. Sometimes they go slumming as students of the
evils of society. They are like pious uncles who
never swear themselves under any circumstances, but
relate stories of other men who do, recite their delightful
experiences and roll out the awful oaths with
which the profane gave vent to their feelings with a
relish that is no doubt a relief to their own.</p>

<p>It is, I suppose, our inheritance from the Puritans,
or the worst of our inheritance from the Puritans,
and it is possible that it is worth while to
have paid the penalty as a price for the best we
derived from them, since one has to take the bad with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the good, though in those days I often wished that
the bequest had gone to some other of the heirs.
Perhaps in thus speaking of the good we had from
them, I am merely yielding to the fear of saying
openly what I have often thought, namely, that the
good we had from the Puritans has been immensely
overestimated and exaggerated, and is not one whit
better or greater in quantity or influence than that
we had from the Cavaliers, or for that matter from
the latest emigrant on Ellis Island. They themselves
appreciated their own goodness, and we have always
taken their words for granted. I have often thought
that some day, when I had the elegant leisure necessary
to such a task, I should like to write &#8220;A History
of Puritanism,&#8221; or, since I should have to place
the beginnings of the monumental work in Rome as
far back at least as the reign of the first Emperor,
perhaps I should be less ambitious and content myself
with writing &#8220;A History of Puritanism in the
United States of America.&#8221; I should have to begin
the larger work at that interesting period of the history
of Rome when the weary Augustus was being
elected and re&euml;lected president against his will and
trying to gratify the spirit of Puritanism that was
even in such people as those Romans, by enacting all
sorts of sumptuary laws and foolish prohibitions,
and trying out to miserable failures every single one
of the proposals that have since that time been made
over and over again in the hope of regenerating
mankind. The story of how the Emperor&#8217;s own
daughter was almost the first to disobey his regulations
is dramatic enough to conclude rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
to begin any history, and yet I could write it with
much more pity than I could the story of those
Puritans who abounded in my own locality in my
own time. To write fairly and philosophically of
them I should have to wait not only for a leisure
so large and so elegant that I am certain never to
have it, but I should have to cultivate a philosophic
calm which I own with shame is far from me when
I think of some of the things they, or some of
them, did in their efforts to force their theories on
others. I should not recall such things now, and if
I were to put them in that monumental and scholarly
work of my imagination, it should be, of course, only
in the cold scientific spirit, and as specimens, say
in nonpariel type, at the foot of the page with the
learned annotations.</p>

<p>Speaking of this passion for laws and regulations
and how some of the zealous would order even the
most private and personal details of life in these
states, Mr. Havelock Ellis, in a brilliant chapter of
his work, &#8220;The Task of Social Hygiene,&#8221; takes occasion
to observe that &#8220;nowhere in the world is there so
great an anxiety to place the moral regulation of
social affairs in the hands of police,&#8221; and that
&#8220;nowhere are the police more incapable of carrying
out such regulation.&#8221; The difficulty is due of course
to the fact that the old medieval confusion of crime
and vice persists in a community where the Puritan
tradition still strongly survives. The incapability,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
as has been pointed out, is not so much in the
policemen as in that <i>b&ecirc;tisse humaine</i> which expects
such superhuman work of them.</p>

<p>This insistent confusion of vice with crime has
not only had the effect of fostering both, but is the
cause of the corruption of the police. Their proper
function is to protect life and property and maintain
the public peace, and this the police of American
cities perform as well as policemen anywhere. But
when, by a trick of the sectarian mind, the term
<i>crime</i> is made to include all the follies and weaknesses
and vices of humanity, where there is added
the duty of enforcing statutes against a multitude
of acts, some of which only Puritanical severity
classes as crimes, others of which are regarded by
the human beings in the community with indifference,
tolerance or sympathy, while still others are inherent
in mysterious and imperative instincts which balk
all efforts at general control, the task becomes
wholly impossible and beyond human ability.</p>

<p>The police know it, and everybody knows it, and
it is the hypocrisy of society that corrupts them.
The police know, intuitively, and without any process
of ratiocination, that people are human, and subject
to human frailties; they are pretty human themselves,
and, in common with most of the people in
the community, see no great wrong in some of the
things that are done which the sumptuary laws condemn.
Most of them, for instance, drink a glass of
beer now and then, or play a game of cards, or go to
a baseball game on Sunday. They are not apt to be
gentlemen of the most refined and exquisite tastes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
And it is difficult to induce men to take much interest
in punishing acts their own consciences do not condemn.
This, with the situation at its best; at its
worst, knowing that, despite all the enactments of
legislatures, people will continue in their hardened
ways, they are apt to abuse their power. For they
know, too, that the statutes prohibiting the merely
venial of those acts oftentimes run counter to the
urban custom and that the community regards it as
of no great consequence if they are not enforced.
Thus a wide discretion is permitted the police by the
public conscience in the discharge of their duties,
and this discretion is one which quite humanly they
proceed to abuse. If they choose, they may enforce
the sumptuary laws against certain persons or refrain
from doing so, and the opportunity for corruption
is presented. The opportunity widens, opens
into a larger field, and not only does the corruption
spread, but it is not long before the police are employing
extra legal methods in other directions, and
at last in many instances establish an actual tyranny
that would not be tolerated in a monarchy. The result
is that we read every day of arbitrary interferences
by policemen with most of the constitutional
rights, such as free speech, the right of assembly and
petition, etc. They even set up a censorship and
condemn paintings, or prohibit the performance of
plays, or assume to banish women from the streets
because they are dressed in a style which the police
do not consider <i>comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p>And while the corruption is deplored and everywhere
causes indignation and despair, this tyranny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
does not seem to excite resistance or even remark;
the press, the paladium of our liberties, does not often
protest against it, and few seem to have sufficient
grasp of the principle to care anything
about it.</p>

<p>There is a story somewhere of a little girl, homeless,
supperless, shivering in rags in the cold rain
of the streets of New York, and of a passer-by observing
in a kind of sardonic sympathy:</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is living under the protection of sixteen
thousand laws!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said his friend, perhaps a professional
reformer of third persons, who naturally lacked a
sense of humor; &#8220;but they were not enforced!&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not altogether inconceivable that if all the
laws had been enforced the little girl&#8217;s condition
would have been even worse than it was, considering
how haphazard had been the process of making all
those laws, and how, if set in motion, many of them
would have clashed with each other.</p>

<p>If they were effective, the whole of human kind
would have been translated, like Enoch, long ago.
Of course, the assertion that they had not been enforced
was the obvious retort. And it was true, because
it is impossible to enforce all of them. And
what is more no one believes that all the laws should
be enforced, all the time,&mdash;that is, no one believes
in absolute law enforcement, since no one believes
that the laws should be enforced against <i>him</i>. Everybody
hates a policeman just as everybody loves a
fireman. And yet the fire department and the police
department are composed of the same kind of men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
paid the same salaries, and responsible to the same
authorities. The duty of the fireman is, of course,
the simpler, because there is no disagreement among
men about the thing to be done. When a fire breaks
out in the city, the fire department is expected to
rush to the spot, to pour water on the fire, and to
continue pouring water on the fire until it ceases to
burn. The reforming mind seems to think that the
duty of the policeman is of equal simplicity, and that
when a wrong is done, the sole duty of the police consists
in rushing immediately to that spot, seizing the
wrongdoer, and, by confining him in a prison, thereby
eradicate his tendency to do wrong, and, by holding
him up as an example to others who are considering
the commission of that wrong, to deter them
from it.</p>

<p>As far as crimes are concerned, the policemen,
indeed, do fairly well. Though that they succeed
in any measure at all in discharging their functions
is a wonder when one considers the contumely
and abuse that are constantly heaped upon them in
all our cities. The newspapers, when there are no
accounts of crime to print&mdash;and the assumption is
that crimes and casualties, if they are horrid enough,
are the principal events in the annals of mankind
worth chronicling&mdash;can always print suggestions of
the crimes of the police. The reporter, a human
being himself, dissatisfied because the policemen cannot
gratify his hunger for sensation, is not to blame,
perhaps; he views life from the standpoint of his
own necessities, and his conception of life is of a
series of exciting tragedies enacted with a view to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
making the first edition interesting, so that the ears
of the populace may be assaulted in the gloom of
each evening&#8217;s dusk by that hideous bellowing of the
news &#8220;boy,&#8221; whose heavy voice booms through the
shade like some mighty portent of disaster in the
world.</p>

<p>This all sounds pretty hopeless, but if morals are
to be wrought by and through policemen, I am sure
we shall have to pay higher salaries, and procure
men who are themselves so moral that their consciences
are troubled only by the sins of others;
there is no other way. Unless, of course, anything
is left in these modern days of the theory of the
development of individual character. But that is the
program of a thousand years.</p>

<p>As for the future of municipal government in this
land, I venture to set down this prediction: That no
appreciable advance will be made, no appreciable
advance can be made in any fundamental sense, so
long as the so-called moral issue is the pivot on
which municipal elections turn, or so long as it is allowed
to remain to bedevil officials, to monopolize
their time and to exhaust their energies, so that
they have little of either left for their proper work
of administration.</p>

<p>Either cities must have home rule, including the
local police power, with the right to regulate amusements
and resorts and even vices according to the
will of the people in that city, whatever the rural
view may be, or some authority other than the
mayor, and far wiser and nobler than any mayor I
ever knew or heard of, must be raised up by the state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
in whom may be united the powers and functions of a
beadle, a censor, and a dictator. I have not the
slightest idea where one so wise and pure is to be
found, but doubtless there are plenty who do, if
their modesty would permit them to speak.</p>

</div>


<p>I used to recall, during the early and acute phase
of this discussion, an incident that occurred in the
old Springfield days in Loami, down in the Sangamon
country. The little village in those days could
boast an institution unlike any, perhaps, in the land,
unless it were to be found in some small hamlet in the
South. In the public square, on a space worn
smooth and hard as asphalt, a great circle was
drawn, and here, every day when the weather was
fine, a company of old men gathered and played
marbles. What the game was I do not know;
some development of one of the boys&#8217; games, no
doubt, but with what improvements and embellishments
only the old men who understood and played
it could say. Its enthralled votaries played with
large marbles, which spun from their gnarled and
horny knuckles all day long, with a shifting crowd
of onlookers gaping at their prowess. The players
were old and dignified, and took their sport seriously.
There were to be seen, about that big ring,
sages who had sat on juries and been swayed by the
arguments of Lincoln; there were gray veterans who
had gone with Sherman to the sea and had been with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Grant at Appomattox; and now, in their declining
years, they found pleasure and a mildly stimulating
excitement in this exercise. The skill they developed
in the game is said by those who have studied the
subject on the ground to have been considerable;
some testify that these elders had raised their sport
to the point of scientific dignity, and that the ability
they displayed ranked them as the equals of golfers
or of billiardists.</p>

<p>The exciting tournaments went on for years, the
old gentlemen were happy, the little village was
peaceful and contented, when suddenly the town
was shocked by a new sensation. Loami elected a
reform administration. How it came about I do not
know; some local muckraker may have practiced his
regenerating art, or perhaps some little rivulet of
the reform wave just then inundating the larger
world outside may have trickled down into Loami.
What privilege in the town was menaced I do not
know; what portion of eminent respectability felt its
perquisites in danger I cannot say; but Privilege
seems to have done what it always does when pursued&mdash;namely,
it began to cry for the reformation
of persons instead of conditions. The new reform
mayor, like many another mayor, was influenced;
and, looking about for someone to reform, his eye
wandered out of the window of the town hall one
May morning and lighted on the grizzled marble-players,
and he ordered the constable into action.</p>

<p>Upon what legal grounds he based his edict I
cannot say. It is not vital for, as there were about
sixteen thousand laws then running in his jurisdiction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
it would not have been difficult to justify his
action on legal grounds. It will be remembered that
the old men were playing in the public square; perhaps
they played &#8220;for keeps,&#8221; and it may have been
that there were certain little understandings of a
speculative nature on the side. Above all, the old
men were enjoying themselves, and if this were not
a sufficient offense what could be? And if a constable&#8217;s
highest duty were not to interfere with the
enjoyment of other folks what would become of the
constitution and the law?</p>

<p>At any rate the old men were forbidden to play,
their game was rudely interrupted, their ring obliterated,
their marbles confiscated. There was, of
course, resistance; some skirmishing and scrimmaging;
a heated, acrimonious proceeding in the mayor&#8217;s
court, and afterward hatred and strife and bad
feeling, the formation of factions, and other conditions
catalogued under law and order. But at
length the space worn so smooth under the trees
near the bandstand was sodded, and the old fellows
might gather in silent contemplation of a new sign,
&#8220;Keep off the Grass,&#8221; and reflect upon this supreme
vindication of authority.</p>

<p>But Loami is a democracy, or as much of a democracy
as the state will permit it to be, and when the
next election rolled around the old men were alert,
and after an exciting contest they elected a mayor
of their own, a liberal. The reform mayor was relegated
to the political limbo of one-termers, the
privileged few preserved their privileges, and the old
men, skinning the sod off that portion of the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
square, drew anew their huge bull-ring, resumed their
game, and everybody was happy and unreformed
except, of course, the reformers; though perhaps
they were happy, too, in their restored misery of
having something to complain about and to wag
their heads over.</p>

<p>In relating this veracious little tale of the lid of
Loami, perhaps I have not sufficiently revealed that
attitude of moral sympathy toward the good characters
in the story which Tolstoy insists a writer
should always assume and maintain. But this has
not been due to any want of that sympathy. In the
shadows of the scene the figure of the mayor, for
instance, has ever been present&mdash;the keenest sufferer,
the most unhappy man of them all. He was the one
of all of them who was burdened with official responsibility;
the marble-playing faction was happy in
that it had no responsibility save of that light, artificial
sort imposed by the rules of its game; its conscience,
indeed, was untroubled. The other faction&mdash;the
goo-goos, or whatever they were called in
Loami&mdash;felt responsible primarily for the short-comings
of others; their consciences were troubled only
by the sins of other people, the easiest and most
comfortable, because it is the most normal, position
that the human conscience can assume. But the
mayor was held responsible for everything and everybody,
and in seeking to do his duty he found that
difficulty which must everywhere increase in a society
and a civilization which, in casting off some of its
old moorings, recognizes less the responsibility of
parent and teacher, not to mention personal responsibility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and is more and more disposed to look to
the law and its administrators as the regulators and
mentors of conduct.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XLIV</h2>
</div>


<p>It is an axiom of municipal politics that a reform
administration, or an administration elected as a
protest against the evils of machine government,
boss rule, and the domination of public service corporations,
is immediately confronted by the demand
of those who call themselves the good people to
enforce all the sumptuary laws and to exterminate
vice. That is, the privileged interests and their allies
and representatives seek to divert the attention of
the administration from themselves and their larger
and more complex immoralities to the small and
uninfluential offenders, an old device, always, in the
hope of escape, inspired by privilege when pursued,
just as friends of the fox might turn aside the
hounds by drawing the aniseed bag across the trail.
Many a progressive administration in this land has
been led into that <i>cul de sac</i>, and as Mr. Carl Hovey
observed recently of the neat saying to the effect
that the way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce
it, the process usually proves to be merely the way
to get rid of a good administration. The effort had
been made by the opponents of Golden Rule Jones
and it had failed. It had been attempted in the case
of Tom Johnson and it had failed, though curiously
enough the effort was never made in Toledo or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Cleveland or in Cincinnati, or elsewhere for that
matter, in the days of machine domination. The
Puritan never lets his religion interfere with business.</p>

<p>I used often to recall, in those days, a witty saying
of Mr. William Travers Jerome, when he was
District Attorney in New York. He said he often
wished that there were two volumes of the Revised
Statutes, one to contain the laws enacted for human
beings, and the other to embalm the moral yearnings
of rural communities.</p>

<p>It was disturbing and discouraging, of course, to
feel that out there in the community there was this
shadowy mass of well intentioned people, the most
of whom no doubt, in common with all the rest of us,
did wish to see moral improvement, and yet so misconstrued
and misinterpreted our efforts. It was
saddening, too, because in the work we were trying
to do we should have liked their sympathy, their interest
and their support. Because of their wider
opportunity of enlightenment much better and
nobler things might have been demanded of them,
but as Johnson Thurston one night pointed out,
they did not show as much civic spirit, as much concern
for the common weal as those of smaller opportunities,
those bad people as they called them of
whom much less would naturally have been expected.
I made a rule, as I have already said somewhere in
these pages, not to talk back, or to argue with
them. They viewed life from the Puritan standpoint,
and I suppose that I viewed it from the pagan
standpoint. The sins of others and their mistakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
and failures never did excite in me that moral indignation
which exists in the breasts of some; perhaps
the old distinction between bad people and good
people had been blurred in my consciousness. I
could see that the bad people did many good things in
their lives, and that the good people thought many
dark and evil thoughts. I had seen indeed so much
more kindness and consideration, so much more pity
and mercy shown by the bad that I felt strengthened
in my philosophy and in my belief that if their environment
could be improved, if they could have a
better chance in life, they would be as good as anybody.
It seemed to me that most of the crime in
the world was the result of involuntary poverty,
and the tremendous, perhaps insuperable task, was
to make involuntary poverty impossible. But in the
meantime there was other work to be done. Aside
from the problem of transportation which was but
one phase of the great struggle between privilege
and the people, of plutocracy with democracy, there
were civic centers, city halls, markets, swimming
pools, bridges to be built, parks to be improved,
boulevards and parkways to be laid out, a filtration
plant to be installed, improvements in all of the
other departments, a great mass of wonderful work
for the promotion of the public amenities, the public
health, and the adornment of the city, in a word,
there was a city to be built, and strangely enough
this group of objectors of whom I have been speaking,
were so intensely preoccupied with moral considerations
that they never had even the slightest interest
in these improvements. I think it is this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
spirit of Puritanism that has made the cities of
America so ugly, or permitted them to be ugly;
such conceptions as beauty and ugliness are perhaps
impossible to minds that know no distinction
but good and bad, and for this reason it has been
difficult to make an &aelig;sthetic appeal with any effectiveness.</p>

<p>During three of my four terms in that office the
nasty quarrel about morals raged. As I look back
and think now with what virulence it did rage, it
appeals to me as a remarkable psychological phenomenon.
Of course it was bad for those who engaged
in it, and bad for the town as well, for such
an exaggerated idea of conditions was given that the
police in neighboring cities, clever rogues that they
were, could always excuse and exculpate themselves
for any of their delinquencies by saying that the
thieves that had come to town hailed from Toledo,
or that those they could not catch had gone and
taken refuge there. But I did not engage in the
discussion nor permit the police officials to do so.
There was no time, since there was so much other
work to do, and we went on as well as we could with
what Tom Johnson used to call the policy of administrative
repression, improving moral conditions with
such means as we had. We did succeed in eliminating
the wine rooms, in closing the saloons at midnight,
and finally, after a tremendous effort, in extirpating
professional gambling. It was of no consequence
that it did not have any effect upon criticism,
for we did not do it to stop criticism, and the
discussion went on until I had been elected for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
third time, and immediately after that election when
a large majority of the people had again spoken
their minds on the subject, it was considered the
proper time to reopen the discussion and to hold a
so-called civic revival. The young, uncultured man
they brought to town to conduct that revival, could
have known nothing whatever of life, and was wholly
unconscious of the great economic forces which,
with so much complexity and friction, were building
the modern city. He came to call on me before he
opened his revival that he might have, as he said, a
personal, private and confidential talk. When I
asked him how the city could be regenerated, he said
he did not know, but this fact did not prevent him
from telling the audiences he addressed that week
just what should be done, and that he, for instance,
could nobly do it, and in the end they sent a committee
to me to tell me what to do, if not how to do
it. I asked the committee to reduce their complaints
to writing, to point out those evils which they considered
most objectionable, and to propose means
of combating them. The committee went away and
I confess I did not expect to see them again because
I had no notion that they could ever agree as to the
particular evils, but after some weeks they had come
to terms on a few heads, and filed their complaint
pointing out several specific vices in town, and as
a remedy proposed that they be &#8220;prevented.&#8221; I
replied to them in a letter in which I said all I
could think of at that time or all I could think of
now on this whole vexed problem. It was printed
in pamphlet form and rather widely circulated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
finally published as a little book.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> I do not know
that it convinced anybody who was not convinced
already. I think we got along a little better afterward
than we had before, and by the time my fourth
term was done the phenomenon of the discussion, if
not the vice, had disappeared. After my letter was
sent to the committee, it was said that they would
reply to it, but they never did, and instead invited
the Reverend William A. Sunday to come to the city
to conduct a revival. It was announced by some
that he came to assault our position, but when he arrived
Captain Anson, the old Chicago baseball
player, under whom Mr. Sunday had played baseball
in his younger days, happened to be giving his monologue
at a variety theater that week, and he and Mr.
Sunday together called on me. I do not know when
I have had a pleasanter hour than that we spent
talking about the old days in Chicago when Anson
had been playing first base and I had been reporting
the baseball games for the old <i>Herald</i>. That, to be
sure, was after the days of Billy Sunday&#8217;s services
in right field, but it was not too late for me to have
known and celebrated the prowess of that famous
infield, Anson, Pfeffer, Williamson and Burns, and
we could celebrate them again and speculate as to
whether there were really giants in those days whose
like was known on earth no more.</p>

<p>Mr. Sunday conducted his revival with the success
that usually attends his efforts in that direction,
but he did not mention me or the administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
until the very close of his visit, when he said that
we were doing as well as anybody could be expected
to do under all the circumstances.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XLV</h2>
</div>


<p>When I referred to the general rule that policemen
are disliked and condemned I should have noticed
certain exceptions. The traffic squad for
instance is generally held in a respect and affection
that is part of the civic pride of the community.
Those fine big fellows on the corner, waving this
way or that with a gesture the flowing traffic of the
street, are greeted with smiles, and, as they assist
in the perilous passage of the thoroughfares, sometimes
with thanks and benedictions. The reason, of
course, is simple; they are not engaged in hurting
people, but in helping people, and so by the operation
of the immutable law, they attract to themselves
the best feelings of the people.</p>

<p>And this is what we tried from the first to have
all our policemen do, to help people and not to hurt
them. It was what Jones had tried to do, and he had
begun with one of the most interesting experiments
in policing a city that has been made in our country.
He took away the clubs from the policemen. He
could have made at first no greater sensation if he
had taken away the police altogether, the protest
was so loud, so indignant, above all so righteous.
What sense of security could a community feel if
the policemen were to have no clubs, how would the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
unruly and the lawless be kept in check when they no
longer beheld this insignia of authority in the hands
of the guardians of the peace? And perhaps to
reassure the righteous and truly good Jones gave
the policemen canes and ran the great risk of making
them ridiculous.</p>

<p>I am not sure that he would have cared much if he
had, since he had so little respect for the police idea,
and of course he had as little regard for organization.
I remember once that at a session of the old
police board he opposed the creation of new sergeants;
he said a sergeant always seemed as superfluous
to him as a presiding elder in the Methodist
Church. With an elected board of police commissioners
over it the police force was pretty certain to
be demoralized, of course, as is any executive department
of government which is directed by a board, for
with a board, unless all the members save one are
either dead or incapacitated, discipline and efficiency
are impossible. We got rid of the board system in
Ohio after two or three sessions of the legislature
had been wrestled with, and though the &#8220;mayor&#8217;s
code&#8221; was never enacted, many of its ideas were
adopted in amendments to the municipal code, so
that we approached the most efficient form of city
government yet devised in our rather close resemblance
to the federal plan.</p>

<p>The time came, however, when the old elected
board of public service was succeeded by a director
of public service appointed by the mayor, and the
old board of public safety by a director of public
safety appointed by the same authority, though that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
was not until I had entered on my third term in the
mayor&#8217;s office. When that time came I appointed as
Director of Public Service Mr. John Robert Cowell,
a Manxman who managed the department of public
works admirably, and to the post of Director of
Public Safety Mr. John Joseph Mooney, whose
services and assistance I had already had on the
board of public safety when that was appointed by
the mayor. And Mr. Mooney was able to work out
many of the improvements we hoped to make in the
police department.</p>

<p>And as Jones had taken the clubs away from the
policemen and given them canes, we took away the
canes and sent them forth with empty hands. Jones
had the idea of doing away with clubs from London
where he observed the bobbies who control the
mighty traffic in the streets of London. We were
therefore able to realize the whole of his ideal in that
respect, and our city, I think alone of all American
cities, could not merit the reproach that a Liverpool
man once made to me when we were discussing superficial
appearances in the two nations. &#8220;The most offensive
thing in America to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the
way in which the policemen parade their truncheons.&#8221;
The public made no complaint at the disappearance
of the canes, but the policemen did; they
felt lost, they reported, without something to twirl
in their hands. We thought of letting them have
swagger sticks, but finally decided that they should
be induced to bear themselves gracefully with their
white gloved hands unoccupied. The white gloves
were the subject of amusement to the boors in town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
who could always be amused at any effort at improvement,
but with them on, and the new uniforms
we had patterned after the uniform worn by the
New York policemen, the members of the department
soon began to have a pride in themselves.</p>

<p>And that was exactly what we were trying to inculcate,
though it was difficult to do, and almost
impossible, one might think, since for generations
policemen have been the target for the sarcasms and
abuse of every voice of the community. The wonder
is, with such an universal conspiracy as exists in
America to give policemen a bad name, that they
have any character left at all. Surely each community
in various ways has done everything it could to
strip its policemen of every shred of reputation and
self respect and with these gone, character might be
expected shortly to follow. Of course the new uniforms
were ridiculed too, but we did not let that
discourage us.</p>

<p>There was the civil-service law to help, and we
were of old devoted to the spirit and even to the
letter of that, though once the letter of that law
compelled us to an injustice, as the letter of any
law must do now and then. We had reorganized
the police department on a metropolitan basis, and
had done the same with the fire department, and in
this department there were accordingly created three
new positions of battalion chiefs, for which captains
were eligible. The oldest ranking captain in the
department was Dick Lawler, by everyone in the
department from the chief down conceded to be the
best fireman in the department, with a long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
untarnished record of devoted duty and quiet, unassuming
bravery. And it was his natural ambition to
round out that career as one of the chiefs. The
examining board held a written test, and as Lawler
was more accomplished in extinguishing, or, as his
comrades expressed it, in fighting fire, and much
more comfortable and at home on the roof of a burning
building than he was at a desk with a pen in his
hand, he did not do very well. When, for instance,
he read a long hypothetical question, setting forth
certain conditions at a fire and asking the applicant
where, under such circumstances, he would lay the
hose, Lawler wrote down as his answer, &#8220;Where it
would do the most good,&#8221; and on that answer the
board marked him zero. The board marked him zero
on so many answers indeed that the net result was
almost zero, and he failed.</p>

<p>It was a kind of tragedy, in its little way, as
he stood in my office that morning on which he came
to appeal from the board, with tears in his eyes.
But the law was obdurate and I was helpless. But I
did point out to the examining board the absurdity
of such methods of testing a man&#8217;s ability, and after
that they allowed a man&#8217;s record to count for fifty
per cent. And it was not long until a vacancy occurred
among the chiefs&mdash;and Lawler was appointed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLVI</h2>
</div>


<p>The questions put to Lawler were perhaps no
more absurd than many a one framed by civil-service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
examiners. In any event the written examination
is apt to do as much harm as good, and for
policemen and firemen we came to the conclusion
that it was almost wholly worthless, once it had
been determined that an applicant could write well
enough to turn in an intelligible report. The initial
qualification on which we came to rely and to regard
as most important was the physical qualification.
There is no way to tell by asking a man questions
whether he will be a good policeman or not;
the only way to find that out is to try him for a
year. But his physical condition can be determined,
and on this basis we began to build the police force,
under the direction of Dr. Peter Donnelly, one of
the ablest surgeons in the country, whose tragic
early death was seemingly but a part of that fate
which took from us in a few short years so many
of the best and brightest of the young men in our
movement. The death of Peter Donnelly left us
desolate because he had a genius for friendship equal
to that genius as a surgeon which enabled him to
render a great social service.</p>

<p>He was perfectly rigid in the examinations to
which he subjected applicants for positions in the
department, and wholly inaccessible to any sort of
influence in favor of the unfit. In the old days,
which by many were regretted as the good old days,
the only qualification an applicant needed was a
friend on the police board, and as a result the force
was encumbered with the lame, the halt, and the
blind; there were drinkers if not drunkards among
them, and the paunches which some bore before them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
were so great that when they took their belts off and
hung them up in those resorts where they accepted
the hospitality of a midnight meal, the belts seemed
to be as large as the hoops of the Heidelberg tun.
We rid the force of these as quickly as it could be
done, and the recruits who replaced them were, because
of Dr. Donnelly&#8217;s care and service, superb
young fellows, lithe and clean, who bore themselves
with self respect and an ardent pride in that <i>esprit
de corps</i> we were enabled to develop.</p>

<p>But before that spirit could exist there were defects
other than physical that must be removed;
there were old jealousies and animosities, some of a
religious, or rather a theological nature&mdash;relic of an
old warfare between the sects that once devastated
the town with its unreasoning and remorseless and
ignorant hatred; a St. Patrick&#8217;s day had once been
celebrated by dismissing a score or more of Irishmen
from the police department. There were other
differences of race origin, and in doing away with all
these, so far as it could be done, Mr. Mooney, the
Director of Public Safety, had to his assistance the
ability and the tact of two crusted old characters on
the force, one of them the Chief of Police, Perry D.
Knapp, and the other Inspector John Carew, whose
hair had so whitened in the days he served the city
as a detective that he was called Silver Jack. He
was one of the ablest detectives anywhere, though
prejudice and jealousy had kept him down for a
long time. I had known him in my youth, and later
in the courts, and now that I had the chance I put
him at the head of the detective department, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
when I was tired of the troubles which harassed him
and me during the day, I tried sometimes to forget
them at night by writing stories in which he figured
as the clever detective he was.</p>

<p>And as for Perry Knapp, I suppose there was not
another chief of police like him anywhere. Over his
desk was a picture of Walt Whitman, and in his
heart was the love for humanity that Whitman had,
and in his library were well read copies of Emerson
and a collection of Lincolniana I have often envied
him. He had served in close association with Jones,
who had made his position difficult by promoting him
over the heads of others in the department who
ranked him, and he was the heir of all the old distrust
of Jones&#8217;s attitude toward life. Nevertheless,
he found a way to apply Jones&#8217;s theories to the
policing of a city without any of that ostentation
which in some cases has brought such methods into
disfavor. I cannot, of course, describe his whole
method, but he was always trying to help people
and not to hurt them. He established a system by
which drunken men were no longer arrested, but,
when they could not be taken home as were those
club members with whom he tried in that respect at
least to put them on a parity, they were cared for at
police headquarters until morning, and then with
a bath and a breakfast, allowed to go without leaving
behind to dog their footsteps that most dreadful
of all fates, a &#8220;police record.&#8221; No one will ever
know how many poor girls picked up in police raids
he saved from the life to which they had been tempted
or driven, by sending them back to their homes when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
they had homes, or in some manner finding for them
a way out of their troubles. And I shall always remember
with a pleasure that there is such good in
humanity after all, when I recall that boy in the
workhouse whom a father in a far-off city was seeking.
The boy was working with other prisoners on
a bit of public work in one of the parks that winter
morning, and after he had secured a parole, the
Chief drove out to the park, and got the boy,
clothed him with garments he had bought himself,
bought a railway ticket and sent the boy away to
Chicago and his home. If he had waited until the
lad was brought in at night, he explained, the old
man would have lost a whole day of his son&#8217;s companionship!</p>

<p>That is what I mean when I say that a government
should be made human, or part of what I mean;
such incidents are specifically noticeable because they
stand out in such contrast against the hard surface
of that inhuman institutionalism the reformers with
their everlasting repressions and denials and negatives
are trying to make so much harder. Charley
Stevens, the old circus man whom I appointed as
Superintendent of the Workhouse, very successfully
applied the some principle to the management of
that institution, which he conducted with his humor
and quaint philosophy more than by any code of
rules. He usually referred to his prison as the Temple
of Thought, and he abolished from it all the
marks of a prison, such as stripes and close cropped
polls, and all that sort of thing. He was criticized,
of course, since the conventional notion is that prisoners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
should be made to appear as hideous as possible;
I am pretty sure that reformer disapproved who
one Sunday afternoon went down there and asked
the superintendent if he would permit him to preach
to the inmates and was told by Stevens that he would
like to accommodate him, but that he could not just
then break up the pedro game. There were those
who said that he was making it too easy for the
prisoners, and yet every now and then some of them
would escape, and when they were brought back, as
they usually were, they were met only with reproaches
and asked why they could not leave their
addresses when they went away so that their mail
could be forwarded. There were, however, two escaping
prisoners who never were returned. They
got away just in time to make a sensation for the
noon editions of the newspapers, and as I was on
my way to luncheon I met Stevens, standing on
the street corner, very calmly, while the newsboys
were crying in our ears the awful calamity that
had befallen society. When I asked what he was
doing, he said that he was hunting the escaped prisoners.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to the Secor and the Boody
House,&#8221; he said, naming two leading hotels, &#8220;and
they&#8217;re not there. I&#8217;m going over to the Toledo
Club now, and if they&#8217;re not there, I don&#8217;t know
where to look for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be that in these little incidents I give the
impression that he was a trifler, but that is not the
case. He knew, of course, that so far as doing any
good whatever in the world is concerned, our whole
penal system is a farce at which one might laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
if it did not cause so many tears to be shed in the
world. But he did try to be kind to the inmates,
and by the operation of the parole system succeeded
to an extent commensurate with that attained by
Dr. Cooley of Cleveland. Of course it was all done
under the supervision of Mr. Mooney, the Director
of Public Safety, who rightly characterized our
whole penal system when he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever you send one to prison you send four
or five; you send a man&#8217;s wife and his mother, and
his sister and his children, who are all innocent, and
you never do him any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the workhouse, though under Mr. Mooney&#8217;s
direction, was not connected with the police department,
except in the archaic minds of those who
thought if we were only harsh and hard enough in
our use of both, we could drive evil, or at least the
appearance of evil, out of the city, and leave it,
standing like a rock of morality, in the weltering
waste of immorality all about us.</p>

<p>In no respect has the utter impotence of medieval
machinery in suppressing vice been more definitely
proved than in the great failure of society in dealing
with what is called the social evil. Whenever
my mind runs on this subject, as anyone&#8217;s mind
must in the present recrudescence of that Puritanism
which never had its mind on anything else, I
invariably think of Golden Rule Jones and the incidents
in that impossible warfare which worried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
him into a premature grave. He was an odd man,
born so far out of his time that the sins of others
never troubled his conscience. He was so great, and
knew so much of life, more perhaps than he did of
history, on every page of which he would have found
the confirmations of the opinions life had taught
him, that he divined all lewdness, all obscenity to be
subjective and not objective, so that he found less
to abhor in the sins of the vicious than in the state
of mind of their indefatigable accusers and pursuers.
And he had his own way of meeting their complaints.
Once a committee of ladies and gentlemen called
upon him with the demand that he obliterate the
social evil, off-hand and instantly. They were simple,
brief and to the point. They informed him
that the laws providing for chastity were being
broken, that there were prostitutes in the city, and
in short, urged him to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what am I to do?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;These
women are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the police,&#8221; they said, a new, simple and
happy device suddenly occurring to them, &#8220;drive
them out of town and close up their houses!&#8221; They
sat and looked at him, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where shall I have the police drive them?
Over to Detroit or to Cleveland, or merely out into
the country? They have to go somewhere, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a detail that had escaped them, and
presently, with his great patience, and his great
sincerity, he said to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a proposition. You go and select<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
two of the worst of these women you can find, and
I&#8217;ll agree to take them into my home and provide for
them until they can find some other home and some
other way of making a living. And then you, each
one of you, take one girl into your home, under the
same conditions, and together we&#8217;ll try to find homes
for the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at him, then looked at each other, and
seeing how utterly hopeless this strange man was,
they went away.</p>

<p>To be sure, that was in another day. Prostitution
had not become a subject for polite conversation
at the dinner table; pornographic vice commissions
had not been organized and provided with
appropriations so that their hearings might be stenographically
reported and published along with the
filthy details gathered in the stews and slums of cities
by trained smut hunters; it had not yet been discovered
that the marriage ceremony required a new
introduction, based upon the scientific investigations
of the clinical laboratory, and on the same brilliant
thought that centuries ago struck the wise men of
Bohemia, who, when the population increased too
rapidly, prohibited marriages for a number of years
that proved, of course, to be the most prolific the
land had ever known.</p>

<p>The new conception was created in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye, by the necromancy of a
striking phrase. I do not know who it is that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
the felicity to employ it first in its present relation.
I remember that long years ago, when as a boy I used
to frequent the gallery of the theater, I sat rapt
afar in the mystery and romance of life on the
Mississippi while gazing on the scenes of Bartley
Campbell&#8217;s melodrama &#8220;The White Slave.&#8221; I can
call back now, with only a little effort of the imagination
and the will, that wonderful pageant&mdash;the
<i>Natchez</i>, the <i>Robert E. Lee</i>, the great steamboats
I knew so well from Mark Twain&#8217;s book, the plantation
hands, the darkies singing on the levee, the
moonlight and the jasmine flower&mdash;and there was
no David Belasco in those days to set the scene
either, nor, for the imagination of youth, any need
of one! And then the beautiful octoroon, so lily
white and fragile that it should have been patent to
all, save perhaps an immoral slave-holder, from the
very first scene, that she had no drop of negro blood!
And the handsome and cruel owner and master, with
his slouch hat and top boots, and fierce mustache
and imperial, taking her to her awful fate down the
river! It was an old story Bartley Campbell used
for his plot, a story which had for me an added
interest, because my grandfather had told it to me
out of his own southern experiences, in those far-off
days when he had business that took him down the
river to New Orleans. And it was a story which,
for a while, in many variants of its original form,
was told all over the land to illustrate the immorality
of slavery. I suspect that it was not altogether
true in its dramatic details; surely no such number
of lovely and innocent creatures were permitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
fling themselves into the Mississippi from the hurricane
decks of steamboats as the repetitions and
variations of that tale would indicate; it would have
been altogether too harrowing to the voyagers,
some few of whom at least must have been virtuous,
and journeyed up and down on peaceful moral missions
of one sort and another. No doubt it was
symbolic of a very wrong condition, and I suppose
that is what justified it in the minds of those who
told it over and over without the trouble of verifying
its essential details. It was a good story, and
in the hands of Mr. Howells it made a good poem,
and it made surely a pretty good play, which, could
it enthrall me now as once it did by its enchantments,
I should like to see again to-night!</p>

<p>But I doubt if I could sit through any one of the
plays that have been written or assuredly are to be
written about the white slaves of to-day. The plot
has been right at hand in the tale that has gone
the rounds of two continents, and resembles that
elder story so closely in its incidents of abduction
that I presume the adapter of its striking title to
the exigencies of current reform must have been old
enough to recognize its essential similarity to the
parent tradition. It was told in books, it served
to ornament sermons and addresses on sociological
subjects, and it has, I believe, already been done in
novels that are among the best sellers. The newspapers
printed it with all its horrific details; it was
so precisely the sort of pornography to satisfy the
American sense of news&mdash;a tale of salacity for the
prurient, palliated and rendered aseptic by efforts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
officials, heated to the due degree of moral indignation,
to bring the concupiscent to justice. I had
been in England, too, when the subject was under
discussion there, and this same story was told to
such effect that Parliament, as hysterical as one
of our own state legislatures, had been led to restore
the brutality of flogging. It was always the same:
some poor girl had been abducted, borne off to a
brothel, ruined by men employed for that purpose,
turned over to aged satyrs, and never heard of more.
Of course there were variations; sometimes the girl
was lured away in a motor car, sometimes by a
request for assistance to some lady who had fainted,
sometimes by other ruses. The story was always
told vehemently, but on the authority of some inaccessible
third person, to doubt or question whom
was to be suspected of sympathy with the outrage.
But however high the station, or unimpeachable the
character of the informants, anyone who had the
slightest knowledge of the rules of evidence, unless
he were especially credulous, would have reason to
doubt the tales. In Toledo it had its vogue. It went
the rounds of gentlemen&#8217;s clubs and the tea tables
of the town, and in the curious way stories have, it
went on and on with new embellishments at each
repetition. I had a curiosity about it, not because
I cared for the realistic details that might as Pooh
Bah used to say, &#8220;lend an air of artistic verisimilitude
to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative,&#8221;
but because here was a chance to test it at
first hand, and so I asked the person most heroically
concerned to come and tell me of an experience that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
had earned for him the plaudits of many of his fellow
citizens and citizenesses. And so he came. He was
a social worker, as they are called, and had had the
training in settlement work which is said to qualify
young persons to deal professionally with the poor
and wicked. He was a rather good looking young
chap, with a smile about his full red lips, who lifted
his mild eyes to yours with perhaps an effort at
frankness too pronounced. He spoke well and
fluently.</p>

<p>One night (he said) at the close of a hard day&#8217;s
work in his mission, a man came to him in evident
distress. The man was a business man, in comfortable
though modest circumstances, with a family of
which perhaps the most interesting member was a
beautiful girl of seventeen. The girl was attending
a high school, where she was in one of the advanced
classes, and the evening before had gone from school
to spend the night at the home of a friend, a girl of
her own age. The next evening, on her failure to
return home, the parents became alarmed, and after
unavailing inquiry at her schoolmate&#8217;s house, and in
other quarters, the distraught father had appealed
to the social worker. The social worker at once
caused an investigation to be made, and by a process
of elimination (as he said, though unlike Sherlock
Holmes, he did not detail the successive steps of his
logic), he concluded that the girl was in a certain
quarter of the city, in fact in a certain street. He
then sent for the father, told him to supply himself
with sufficient money, instructed him in the part he
was to play, and was careful to stipulate that if he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the social worker, were to feign drunkenness or to
indulge in conduct out of keeping with his character,
the father was patiently and trustingly to await
results. Thereupon they set forth, and before midnight
visited some thirty houses of ill fame. In the
thirty-first house the suspicions of the social worker
were confirmed, and, pretending to be intoxicated,
he invited an inmate to accompany him, and ascended
to the upper floor. He tried the doors along the
hall, and finding them all open but one, and that
locked, he lurched against it, broke it open, and on
entering the room surprised a young woman, entirely
nude, who screamed&mdash;until he muttered some word
of understanding and encouragement. Meanwhile
the inmate had summoned madame the proprietress,
who flew up the stairs, burst into the room and emptied
her revolver at the social worker.</p>

<p>The social worker, at this supreme moment in his
recital, paused, and with a weary but reassuring
smile, as who should say such adventures were diurnal
monotonies in his life, remarked: &#8220;with no damage,
however, to anything but the furniture and the
woodwork.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had the girl in his arms, and, thrusting
aside foiled madame and the inmate, bore his charge
downstairs, snatched a raincoat from the hall rack,
wrapped it about her, called to the father to come,
and escaped into the street.</p>

<p>After the rescued girl had been restored to her
home, and sufficiently recovered from her terrible
experience to give a connected account of herself, she
related the following incidents: Leaving school on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
that night she had started for the home of the girl
whom she was to visit&mdash;the girl not having attended
school that day&mdash;and while passing a house in a
respectable residential district, about five o&#8217;clock of
the winter evening, darkness already having fallen,
a woman came to the door and in great distress told
the girl that a baby was sick, that she was alone,
and implored the girl to come in and care for the
baby while she ran for a doctor. The girl complied,
and on reaching the door, was immediately seized,
drawn into the hallway, her cries smothered by a
hand in which there was a handkerchief saturated
with chloroform, and she knew no more until she regained
consciousness in the place where the social
worker had rescued her.</p>

<p>Here his direct recital ended. I put to him two
or three questions: Who is the girl? Where is she
now? Where is the house into which she was beguiled?
Where is the brothel in which she was
imprisoned? He had answers for all these. The
girl&#8217;s name could not be divulged, even in official
confidence, for the family could not risk publicity;
the house where she had been summoned to care for
the ailing baby was the home of wealthy and respectable
people, who had been out of town at the
time, and their residence had been broken into and
used temporarily by the white slavers. As for the
brothel, the social worker, by methods he did not
disclose, had compelled the proprietress to leave the
city, and the place was closed.</p>

<p>Such was the amazing adventure of the social
worker. It was easy to imagine the effect of it when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
related to neurotic women, to prurient and sentimental
men, and in country churches to gaping
yokels curious about &#8220;life&#8221; in the city. It was easy
to understand the effect it would have on minds
starved and warped by Puritanism, ready for any
sensation, especially one that might stimulate their
moral emotions, and give them one more excuse for
condemning the police. No wonder certain of the
elect brethren in gratitude for having been told just
what they wished to hear had contributed hundreds
of dollars, that the &#8220;work&#8221; might go on!</p>

<p>I determined, therefore, that in one instance, at
least, the truth as to this stock story should be discovered,
and I requested Mr. Mooney, the Director
of Public Safety, to make a complete investigation.
He detailed to the task the best of his detectives;
the inspectors of the federal government under the
white slave laws were called in, and I asked two
clergymen of my acquaintance who knew the social
worker and said they believed him, to give what aid
they could. Together they worked for weeks. They
made an exhaustive investigation, and their conclusion,
in which the clergymen joined, was that there
was not the slightest ground for the silly tale.</p>

<p>It was, of course, simply another variant of the
story that had gone the rounds of the two continents,
a story which had been somehow psychologically
timed to meet the hysteria which the pulpit,
the press, and the legislatures had displayed, as had
the people, in one of those strange moral movements
which now and then seize upon the public mind, and,
in effect, make the whole population into a mob,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
which is, of coarse, the most moral thing in the
world. The subject was investigated in England
and it was shown that not one of the stories told in
this cause there had any foundation in fact.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> So
far as I know, no authentic verification of the story
in any of its forms has ever been made. And yet it
was the stock in trade of the professional moralists
and was employed by them in two continents to generate
that hysteria without which they cannot carry
on their reforms. It was repeated and accepted&mdash;that
is all, and to doubt it was to make oneself
<i>particeps criminis</i>, a sort of accessory after the
fact.</p>

<p>It is a subject which only the student of morbid
psychology, I suppose, can illuminate properly, but
I fancy he would find somewhere a significance in
the phrase &#8220;white slave,&#8221; when acted upon by minds
that had never been refined enough to imagine any
but the grossest of objective crimes, and out of all
this there arose a new conception of the prostitute
quite as grotesque as that which it replaced. She
was no longer the ruined and abandoned thing she
once was, too vile for any contact with the virtuous
and respectable; she no longer occupied even the
sacrificial pose in which Cato centuries ago and
Lecky in our own time figured her; she was not even
that daughter of joy whose dalliance is the secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
despair of moralists too prudent to imitate her
abandon; she became the white slave, a shanghaied
innocent kept under lock and key. And thousands
and thousands of her sisters were said to be trapped
every year in precisely the same way by the minions
of a huge system, organized like any modern combination
of rapacity and evil, with luxurious headquarters,
presumably in some sky-scraper in New
York, and its own attorneys, agents, kidnappers,
crimpers, seducers, panderers and procuresses all
over the land, a vast and complicated organization,
with baffling ramifications in all the high and low
places of the earth. The sensational newspapers referred
to it as &#8220;the white slave syndicate,&#8221; as though
it were as authentic as the steel trust or Standard
Oil. It was even said that somewhere in New York
the trust conducted a daily auction! With such a
bizarre notion, the victims of their own psychic lasciviousness
became obsessed. Raids and &#8220;revivals&#8221;
must be inaugurated, a body of new laws enacted,
and a horde of official inspectors, agents and detectives
turned loose on the land, empowered to arrest
any man and woman traveling together, and hold the
man guilty of a felony.</p>

<p>To be sure, it was something to have the conception
change. It was something that the prostitute
should at last be regarded with some touch of human
pity. And it was something, a great deal, indeed,
that there was, with all the fanatical and zealous
law making, some quiet study of the problem. The
word &#8220;economic,&#8221; so long scorned by the proponents
of an absolute morality, somehow penetrated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
public consciousness, and at last it dawned on the
human mind that prostitution is related to economic
pressure. But, unfortunately, by the familiar
human process, the mind leaped to extremes; it was
assumed that all prostitutes were girls who did not
receive sufficient wages, and the simple and all sufficient
cure was to be the minimum wage; instead of
receiving eight dollars a week and going to the bad,
all working girls were to be paid nine dollars a week
and remain virtuous. And of course new work for
the constable was cut out; if the employers of girls
did not pay them that much, they were all to go to
jail, and if the girls did not remain chaste after they
had been assured of that splendid income, they
must go to the pillory for the godly to spit at.
This, with the laws against white slavery, was to be
the panacea, and prostitution, a problem which had
perplexed the thoughtful for thirty centuries, was
to be solved before the autumn primaries, so that
those who solved it might get their political rewards
promptly.</p>

<p>I used to wish, when it was presented to me as
mayor, that some of these cock-sure persons who
would solve the problem off-hand by issuing a general
order to the police, could get themselves elected
to the opportunity. Of course I issued no general
order on the subject; perhaps I was too skeptical,
too much lacking in faith in the miraculous powers
of the constabulary. Our city was like all cities;
there were prostitutes in brothels, prostitutes in
saloons, prostitutes in flats, prostitutes on the
streets at night. There were, for instance, a score<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
or more of disorderly saloons where men and women
congregated. But we found that merely by posting
a policeman in uniform before such a place, its
patronage was discouraged, and in a few days discontinued.
Of course it was a dangerous and preposterous
power to wield; in the hands of unscrupulous
police it might have appalling possibilities of
evil. I had the idea of stationing a policeman before
a disorderly house from Tom Johnson, who told me
he had it from his father&mdash;who was Chief of Police
in Louisville. And so we adopted it, and after a
while the wine rooms were no more. And that was
something. But the girls in them, of course, had to
go somewhere, just as Jones said.</p>

<p>Then we found that the police, if they were brutal
enough, could drive the girls off the streets. It
seemed to me always a despicable sort of business&mdash;the
actions of the police I mean; I didn&#8217;t like to
hear the reports of it; I don&#8217;t like to think of it,
or write of it even now. It is not very creditable
to make war on women, whatever the Puritans may
say. But the streets would show an improvement,
even they would admit; much as they might linger
and loiter and leer, the most seductively pure of
them could not get himself &#8220;accosted&#8221; anywhere
down town at night. Of course, after a while, the
poor things would come back, or others exactly like
them would come. Then the police would have to
practice their brutalities all over again. Perhaps
they were not brutal enough; I am not certain. To
be sure they were not as brutal as Augustus with his
sumptuary laws, or as Theodosius, or Valentinian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
or Justinian, or Karl the Great, or Peter the Great,
or St. Louis, or Frederick Barbarossa, or the Empress
Maria Theresa in Vienna, or as John Calvin
in Geneva, or Cotton Mather in Massachusetts, with
all their tortures and floggings and rackings and
brandings and burnings; or as the English Puritans
who used to have bawds whipped, pilloried, branded
and imprisoned and for a second offense put to
death. And even they were not brutal enough, it
seems, since prostitution went right on down the
centuries to our times. I suppose that we might
have learned from their failures that prostitution
could not be ended by physical force and brutality.
However, when the girls were driven from the streets,
inasmuch as the police did not despatch them, they
still had to go somewhere, and the brothels remained.
They had their own quarter and if it was not a segregated
quarter it was something very like it, since the
police bent their efforts to rid other portions of the
city of such places. It was perhaps a tolerated
rather than a segregated district, and after a while
the Director of Public Safety wished to try the experiment
of making it a regulated district as well.
I felt that the world was too old and I found myself
too much of its mood to hope that any good could
come from any of the efforts of policemen to dispose
of such a problem, but I was glad of any experiment
conducted in sincerity that might make for
the better, and accordingly the Director of Safety
put his scheme into operation. It was not <i>reglementation</i>
in the exact European sense, since the temper
of our American people will not acquiesce in that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
and, as I discovered by some inquiries of my own in
the principal cities of Europe, it is not of very valid
effect over there. But the Director adopted most
of the familiar requirements of the Parisian <i>reglement</i>,
except the examinations, and the registration
of those not <i>en maison</i>; he required the
proprietresses to report at police headquarters the
presence of new inmates; he forbade them to have
minors or male parasites in the houses, and as far
as possible he separated the business from the saloon
business. Any house which ignored his orders found
a policeman posted before it; then it came to time.
The result was, as Mr. Mooney could report in the
course of a year, that the number of brothels had
been reduced from over two hundred to thirty and
the number of prostitutes of whom the police had
any knowledge, in an equal proportion. He was
very proud when General Bingham complimented his
policemen and their policing, as he was at similar
compliments from the government&#8217;s white slave
agents.</p>

<p>Superficially this was a very gratifying report,
but only superficially. Five-sixths of the brothels
had been closed, but their inmates had to go somewhere,
just as Jones said, and the police found that
clandestine prostitution had proportionately increased;
the women had gone into flats, or hotels, or
residences which on occasion could be made to serve
as assignation houses. It may perhaps have improved
the life of the prostitute, made it freer and
more human, or perhaps it indicated that prostitution
in America is showing a decadent tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
toward refinement. But while they had reduced the
number of houses of prostitution, the police discovered
that they had not reduced prostitution in the
least, and when, after a trial of four years, I asked
the Director and the Chief of Police what the result
of the experiment had been, they said that, aside
from the fact that it seemed to make for order in
the city, and simplified the work of policing, it had
done no good.</p>

<p>The experience was like that of Chicago, where
after a police order prohibiting the sale of liquor in
houses of prostitution, it was found&mdash;according to
the report of the vice commission&mdash;to be &#8220;undoubtedly
true that the result of the order has been
to scatter the prostitutes over a wide territory and
to transfer the sale of liquor carried on heretofore
in houses to the near-by saloon keepers, and to
flats and residential sections, but it is an open
question whether it has resulted in the lessening
of either of the two evils of prostitution and
drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>The experience, I think, is probably universal. I
used to hear the systems of regulation used in European
cities held up as models by the pessimistic as
the only practical method of dealing with the problem.
Paris was commonly considered as the ideal
in this respect; latterly it is apt to be Berlin. But
the fact is that the <i>reglementation</i> which for years
and years has been in force in Paris is a failure; the
experience there was precisely what it was in our
little city. And from Berlin, which the well-known
German genius for organization has made the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
efficiently governed city in the world, the same failure
has been reported.</p>

<p>In England, on the other hand, there is no regulation;
any evening along Piccadilly, one may see
street walkers whom the police never dream of molesting.
It is in part due to the traditional Puritanic
attitude of our northern race, and partly to the respect
for personal liberty that exists in England.
There the principle is much more scrupulously respected
than with us, with whom individual liberty
indeed, is hardly a principle at all. With us the
phrase &#8220;personal liberty&#8221; is regarded merely as a
shibboleth of brewers and distillers, an evidence on
the part of him who employs it that he is a besotted
slave to drink and an unscrupulous minion of the
rum power. The interferences practiced daily by
our policemen are unknown there, and if, for instance,
it should even be proposed that an enactment
like that in Oklahoma limiting the amount of
liquor a man may keep in his own house, and providing
that agents of the state may enter his domicile
at will and make a search, and especially if in
the remotest region of the British Isles there should
be an instance of what Walt Whitman calls &#8220;the
never ending audacity of elected persons,&#8221; such as
is of daily occurrence in that state where these
agents enter railway trains and slit open the valises
of travelers in their quest of the stuff, the whole of
the question hour the next afternoon in the House
of Commons would be occupied with indignant interpellations
of the home secretary and the <i>Times</i> could
not contain all the letters that would be written.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Other lands have made other experiments, but
everywhere and in all times the same failure has
been recorded, from the efforts of Greece to control
the <i>hetaerae</i> and <i>dicteriades</i> and the severe regulations
of ancient Rome, down to the latest reform
administration in an American city. Nothing that
mankind has ever tried has been of the slightest
avail. And now come the vice commissions with
their pornographic reports, and no doubt feeling
that they have to propose something after all the
trouble they have gone to, when they have set forth
in tabulated statistics what everybody in the world
already knows, they repeat the old ineptitudes.
That is, more law, more hounding by the police.</p>

<p>The Chicago product is the classic and the
model for all of these, and as the latest and loftiest
triumph of the Puritan mind in the realm of morals
and of law, a triumph for which three centuries of
innocence of nothing save humor alone could have
prepared it, its own great masterpiece in morals
was at once forbidden circulation in the mails because
of its immorality!</p>

<p>The problem cannot be solved by policemen,
even if&mdash;as is now recommended&mdash;they be called
&#8220;morals&#8221; police. The word has a reassuring note
of course, possibly by some confused with &#8220;moral&#8221;
police, but policemen are policemen still. I have seen
the <i>police des moeurs</i> in European cities, and they
look quite like other policemen. And all cities
in America have had morals police; that is exactly
what our policemen have been, and that is exactly
what is the matter with them. That is, all cities have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
had detectives especially detailed to supervise the
conduct of the vicious, and they always fail. We
had such a squad in Toledo for years, though it
was not called morals police. It was composed of
men, mere men, because we had nothing else but
men to detail to the work. They were honest, decent,
self-respecting men for the most part, who on
the whole did very well considering the salaries they
were paid and the task imposed on them. They regulated
vice as well as anybody anywhere could regulate
it. But of course they failed to solve the problem,
just as the world for thousands of years has
failed to solve it, with all the machinery of all the
laws of all the lawgivers in history. Solon in
Athens tried every known device, including segregation.
He established a state monopoly of houses
of prostitution, confined the <i>dicteriades</i> to a certain
quarter of the city, and compelled them to wear a
distinctive dress, but all his stringent laws had
broken down long before Hyperides dramatically
bared the breast of Phryne to the Areopagus. In
Rome there was the most severe regulation in
the ancient world and yet&mdash;it may be read in Gibbon&mdash;the
successive experiments of the law under
Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Valerian, Theodosius
and Justinian were all failures, and when the laws
were most rigorous and the most rigorously enforced,
immorality was at its height. Charlemagne
tried and failed, and though the sentiment of the
age of chivalry and the rise of Christianity for a
while softened the law, under the English Puritans,
bawds were whipped, pilloried, branded and imprisoned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and for a second offense put to death. France
was not behind; under Louis IX., prostitutes were
exiled, and in 1635 an edict in Paris condemned men
concerned in the traffic to the galleys for life, while
the women and girls were whipped, shaved and banished
for life. Charles V. in the monastery at Yuste,
trying to make two clocks tick in union, found his
efforts no more vain than his attempts to regulate
human conduct, and Philip II. tried again to do
what his father had been unable to accomplish.
Peter the Great was a grim enforcer of the laws,
and in Vienna Maria Theresa was most rigorous
with prostitutes, putting them in a certain garb, and
then in handcuffs; she was almost as remorseless
in her treatment of them as was John Calvin in
Geneva, which came to have more prostitutes proportionately
than any other city in Europe. Several
modern attempts at annihilation have been
made. Saxony tried to do away with prostitutes,
but they exist in Dresden and other cities of the
Kingdom and Hamburg claims to have banished
them, but in that Free and Hanseatic city I was told
by an American who was investigating the subject
that there were as many there as elsewhere.</p>

<p>And these laws have not only failed, they have
not only stimulated and intensified the evil, but they
themselves have created a white slavery worse than
that of the preposterous tales and sentimental twaddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
that circulate among the neurotic, a white slavery
worse than any ever imagined by the most romanticistic
of the dime novelists or by the most superheated
of the professional reformers. Every one
of these laws has been devised, written and enacted
in the identical spirit with which the Puritans in
Massachusetts branded the red letter on the scarlet
woman. Every one of them is an element of that
brutal and amazing conspiracy by which society
makes of the girl who once &#8220;goes wrong,&#8221; to use
the lightest of our animadversions, a pariah more
abhorred and shunned than if she were a rotting
leper on the cliffs of Molokai. She may be human,
alive, with the same feelings that all the other girls
in the world have; she may have within her the same
possibilities, life may mean exactly the same thing
to her, she may have youth with all its vague and
beautiful longings, but society thunders at her such
final and awful words as &#8220;lost,&#8221; &#8220;abandoned,&#8221;
thrusts her beyond its pale, and causes her to feel
that thereafter forever and forever, there is literally
no chance of redemption for her; home, society,
companionship, hope itself, all shut their obdurate
doors in her face. In all the world there are just
two places she may go, the brothel, or the river,
and even if she choose the latter, that choice, too, is
a sin. She is &#8220;lost&#8221; and the awful and appalling
lie is thundered in her astonished ears by the united
voices of a prurient and hypocritical society with
such indomitable force and persistence that she
must believe it herself, and acquiesce in its dread
finality. And there is no course open to her but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
to go on in sin to the end of days whose only mercy
is that they are apt to be brief. No off-hand moralist,
even by exercising his imagination to the last
degree of cruelty, has ever been able to devise such
a prison as that. White slave, indeed, shackled by
the heaviest chains the Puritan conscience has yet
been able to forge for others!</p>

<p>Strange, too, since the attitude is assumed by a
civilization which calls itself Christian and preaches
that the old law, with its eye for an eye and its
tooth for a tooth, was done away with and lost in a
new and beautiful dispensation. &#8220;Neither do I condemn
thee; go, and sin no more.&#8221; If the world is
ever to solve this problem, it must first of all apprehend
the spirit of this simple and gracious expression,
do away with its old laws, its old cruelties, its
old brutalities, its old stupidities, and approach the
problem in that human spirit which I suspect is so
very near the divine. Once in this attitude, this
spirit, society will be in position to learn something
from history and from human experience, something
from life itself, and what it will learn first is that
Puritanical laws, the hounding of the police, and
all that sort of thing have never lessened prostitution
in the world, but on the contrary have increased
it.</p>

<p>What! Let them go and not do anything to
them? Well, yes, if we can&#8217;t think of anything
better to do to them than to hurt them a little
more, push them a little farther along the road to
that abyss toward which we have been hustling
them. Why is it constantly necessary to do something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
<i>to</i> people? If we can&#8217;t do anything for them,
when are we going to learn to let them alone? Or
must this incessant interference, this meddling, this
mauling and manhandling, go on in the world forever
and ever?</p>

<p>As to what is to be done about it, since all that
ever has been attempted has been so much worse in
its effect than if we had never done anything, I
suppose I need not feel so very much ashamed of
confessing my ignorance and saying that I do not
know. If it were left to me I think the first thing
I should do is to repeal all the criminal laws
on the subject, beginning with that most savage
enactment the Puritan conscience ever devised,
namely, the law declaring certain children &#8220;illegitimate,&#8221;
a piece of stupid brutality and cruelty that
would make a gorilla blush with shame if it were
even suggested in the African jungle.</p>

<p>Yes, the first thing to do is to repeal all the criminal
laws on the subject. They do no good, and even
when it is attempted to enforce them, the result is
worse than futile. I myself, with my own eyes, in
the old police court where I have witnessed so many
squalid tragedies, have seen a magistrate fine a
street walker and then suspend the fine so that, as
he explained to her in all judicial seriousness, she
might go out and &#8220;earn&#8221; enough money to come
back and pay it! And not a person in the court
room, so habituated and conventionalized are we
all, ever cracked a smile or apparently saw anything
out of the way&mdash;least of all the street walker!</p>

<p>But it would not be enough simply to repeal these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
laws from the statute books of the state; it will be
necessary to accomplish the immensely more difficult
task of repealing them from the human heart, where
they were written long ago in anger, and hatred,
and jealousy and cruelty and fear, that is in the
heat of all the baser passions. What I am trying
to say is that the first step in any reasonable and
effective reform is an entire change of attitude on
the subject, and about the only good to be expected
from the agitation about white slavery, with
all its preposterous exaggeration and absurd sensationalism
is that it is perhaps making for a
changed attitude, a new conception; if it will accomplish
nothing more than to get the public mind&mdash;if
there is a public mind, and not a mere public
passion&mdash;to view the prostitute as a human being,
very much like all the other human beings in the
world, it will have been worth all it has cost in energy
and emotion and credulity. If this sort of
repeal can be made effective, if the prostitute can
be assured of some chance in life outside the dead
line which society so long ago drew for her, the first
step will have been taken.</p>

<p>The next step possibly will be the erection of a
single standard of morals. And this cannot be done
by passing a law, or by turning in an alarm for the
police. That means thinking, too, and education,
and evolution, and all the other slow and toilsome
processes of which the off-hand reformers are so
impatient. This single standard will have to be
raised first in each individual heart; after that it
will become the attitude of the general mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>And then the commerce in vice will have to be
stopped. I do not mean prohibited by penal laws
alone. Policemen cannot stop it, and policemen
should have no more to do with it than firemen. In
fact much of the commerce has proceeded from the
fact that its regulation has been entrusted to the
police. It should be a subject for the fiscal laws. It
is, I assume, known by most persons that the owners
of the dilapidated tenements in which for the most
part prostitution is carried on, because of the
&#8220;risk,&#8221; extort exorbitant rentals for them, and then
on the ground that they can rent them to no one of
respectability, they hold them to be so worthless
that they pay little if any taxes on them. Our
present tax laws of course have the effect of rewarding
the slothful, the lazy and the idle, and of
punishing the energetic and the enterprising producer
in business, and it would be quite possible to
revise the tax laws so that tenderloins would be
economically impossible, because they would cease
to be profitable.</p>

<p>In the next place, or some place in the program,
there should be some sort of competent and judicious
sex education. I do not know just who
would impart it, since no one as yet knows very
much about it, but with the earnest, sincere and
devoted work that is being carried on all over the
world by the scientific men and women who are
studying eugenics and social hygiene, there is hope
in this direction, even if it is probable that the
world will not be saved by the new race of athletes
that are scientifically to be bred, and may still have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
some use in its affairs for the minds of its cripples
who in all times have contributed so much to its
advancement.</p>

<p>The marvelous phenomenon known as the feminist
movement which the students and historians of
the next two hundred years will be busy elucidating
will play its part, too, for in its vast impulse toward
the equality of the sexes it must not only bring the
single standard of morals, but it should somehow be
the means of achieving for women their economic
independence. This perhaps would be the most important
of all the steps to be taken in the solution
of the problem. The economic environment of course
is in the lives of many girls a determining factor
and in this connection the minimum wage indeed
has its bearing. The old Puritan laws were conceived
in minds intensely preoccupied with the duty
of punishing people for their sins. Prostitutes were
prostitutes because they were &#8220;bad,&#8221; and when
people were bad they must be punished. But now
we see, or begin to see, if vaguely, that, except in
metaphysics, there is no such thing in our complex
human life as an absolute good or an absolute bad;
we begin to discern dimly the causes of some of the
conduct called bad, and to the problem of evil we
begin to apply the conception of economic influences,
social influences, pathological influences, and
other influences most of us know little or nothing
about.</p>

<p>Thus we begin to see that a girl&#8217;s wages, for instance,
may have something to do with what we call
her morals; not everything, but something. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
wages of a girl&#8217;s father have something to do with
them, too, and the wages of her great grandfather
for the matter of that. So the dividends on which
live the delicate and charming ladies she beholds
alighting from their motor cars every morning in
the shopping district may have something to do with
them, though she is as unconscious and as innocent
of the relation as they, as ignorant as all of us are.
Rents have something to do with them, and so do
taxes.</p>

<p>But after the whole economic system has been re-adjusted
and perfected and equalized, after we have
the minimum wage, and the single tax, and industrial
democracy, and every man gets what he produces,
and economic pressure has been as scientifically adjusted
as the atmospheres in a submarine torpedo
boat, there is always the great law of the contrariety
of things to be reckoned with, according
to which the more carefully planned the event, the
less it resembles the original conception. The human
vision is so weak, and the great circle of life
so prodigious! The solution will come, if it ever
comes at all, by slow, patient, laborious, drudging
study, far from the midnight session of the legislature,
far from the ear and the pencil of the eager
reporter, far from the platform of the sweating revivalist,
far from the head office of the police. Our
fondly perused pornography might expose the whole
of the underworld to the light of day, the general
assembly might enact successive revisions of the revised
statutes for a hundred years, we might develop
the most superb police organization in all history,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
achieving the apotheosis of the Puritan ideal with a
dictagraph in every bedroom and closet in the town,
and it all would be of no avail. The study must
survey the whole field of social and domestic relations,
until the vast mystery of life is understood,
and the relation between its wide antitheses established
as Tolstoy presents them in his story of
the poor mother who took her daughter to the public
house in the village, and the rich mother who, at
the same time, took her daughter to the court at
St. Petersburg. It will be found perhaps in the
long run, for which so few are ever willing to remain,
that the eradicable causes of prostitution are
due to involuntary poverty, and the awful task is
to get involuntary poverty out of the world. It
is a task which has all the tremendous difficulties of
constructive social labor and it is as deliberate as
evolution itself. And even if it is ever accomplished,
there will remain a residuum in the problem inhering
in the mysteries of sex, concerning which even the
wisest and most devoted of our scientists will confess
they know very little as yet and have not much
to tell us that will do us any good.</p>

<p>In taking the present occasion to say so much
about the work in morals which a mayor is expected
to perform, I have a disquieting sense that I have
fallen into a tone too querulous for the subject, and
perhaps taken a mean advantage of the reader in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
telling of my troubles. It is rather a troubled life
that a mayor leads in one of these turbulent American
cities, since so much of his time is taken up by
reformers who seem to expect him somehow to do
their holy work for them, and yet that is doubtless
the business of reformers in this world, and since
it is their mission to trouble someone, perhaps it
is the business of a mayor to be troubled by them
in his vicarious and representative capacity. I
should not deny reformers their rights in this respect,
or their uses in this world, and I should be
the last to question their virtues. John Brown was
beyond doubt a strong character and an estimable
man, who did a great and heroic work in the world,
even if he did do it in opposition to the law, and
by the law was killed at last for doing it, but by all
accounts he must have been a terrible person to live
with, and I have often been glad that I was not
mayor of Ossawattomie when he was living and reforming
there. I would as soon have had Peter the
Hermit for a constituent.</p>

<p>I shall not go quite so far as to admit that our
reformers were as strong in character as either of
these great models I have mentioned, but they were
as persistent, or in combination they were as persistent;
when one tired or desisted, another promptly
took his place; there were so many that they could
spell each other, and work in relays, and thus keep
the torch ever alive and brandishing. It was not
only the social evil with which they were concerned,
but the evil of drink, and the evil of gambling, and
the evil of theaters, and the evil of moving pictures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
and post cards, and of the nude in art, and of lingerie
in show windows, and of boys swimming in the
river, and playing in the streets, and scores of other
conditions which seemed to inspire in them the fear
or the thought of evil.</p>

<p>With the advent of spring, the mayor must put
a stop to lovers wandering in the parks; when summer
comes he must put an end instantly to baseball;
in the winter he must close the theaters and the
dance halls; in short, as I said before, whenever it
was reported from any quarter that there were people
having fun, the police must instantly be despatched
to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>And strangely enough, even when we did succeed
in doing away with some of the evils of the town,
when we closed the saloons promptly at midnight,
the hour fixed by ordinance, when we did away with
many evil resorts, when wine rooms were extirpated,
and the number of <i>maisons de tolerance</i> were reduced
by eighty-five per cent., when gambling was
stamped out, their complaints did not subside, but
went on, unabated, the same as before. They could
not be satisfied because the whole of their impossible
program was not adopted, and more because
there was no public recognition of their infallibility
and no admission of their righteousness. What that
type of mind desires is not, after all, any reasonable
treatment of those conditions, or any honest
and sincere endeavor to deal with them. It demands
intellectual surrender, the acknowledgment of its infallibility,
and a protesting hypocrite can more
easily meet its views than anyone else.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>No wonder then that even such a strong man as
Tom Johnson, one evening, when the day was done,
should fling himself back in the motor car, with the
dark shadow of utter weariness and despair on his
face, and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could take a train to the end of the longest
railway in the world, then go as far as wagons
could draw me and then walk and crawl as far as I
could, and then in the midst of the farthest forest
lie down and rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>We all have such moments, of course, but we
should have fewer of them if we had a national trait
of which I have read, in a book by Mr. Fielding Hall
in relation to Burma. He says the Burmese have
a vast unwillingness to interfere in other people&#8217;s
affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;A foreigner may go and live in a Burman village,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;may settle down there and live his
own life and follow his own customs in perfect freedom;
may dress and eat and drink and pray and
die as he likes. No one will interfere. No one will
try to correct him; no one will be forever insisting
to him that he is an outcast, either from civilization
or from religion. The people will accept him for
what he is and leave the matter there. If he likes
to change his ways and conform to Burmese habits
and Buddhist forms, so much the better; but if not,
never mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a hell Burma would be for the Puritan!
And what a heaven for everybody else! Perhaps we
would all better go live there.</p>

<p>These things, however, should be no part of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
mayor&#8217;s business, and perhaps I may justify my
speaking of them by saying that I spoke of them
principally to make that point clear. They and
some other problems that may or may not be foreign
to his duties, have the effect of keeping a mayor
from his real work which is or should be, the administration
of the communal affairs of the city, and
not the regulation of the private affairs of the people
in it. It is quite impossible to imagine any
work more delightful than this administration.
Hampered in it as one is by politicians, who regard
every question from the viewpoint of the parish
pump, it is nevertheless inspiring to be concerned
about great works of construction regarding the
public comfort and convenience, the public health
and the public amenities. It is in such work that
one may catch a glimpse of the vast possibilities of
our democracy, of which our cities are the models
and the hope.</p>

<p>I have observed in Germany that the mayors of
the cities there are not burdened by these extraneous
issues, and I think that that is the reason the German
cities are the most admirably administered in
the world. Perhaps I should say governed, too,
though that is hardly correct, since the governing
there is done by the state through its own officials.
I have not been in Germany often enough or remained
long enough to be able to assert that government,
in its effect for good, is quite as much a
superstition as it is everywhere; mere political government,
I mean, which seems to be so implicitly
for the selfish benefit of those who do the governing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
But the administration of public affairs is so entirely
another matter, that it is as beautiful, at
least in its possibilities as government is ugly in
its actualities, and it is precisely because there has
been so much insistence on government in our cities
that there is as yet so little administration, and
that so inefficient.</p>

<p>In Germany the burgomeister is not chosen for
his political views, or for his theories of any sort, or
for his popularity; he is chosen because of his ability
for the work he is to perform, and he is retained
in office as long as he performs that work properly.
It is so with all municipal departments and the result
is order and efficient administration. When a
German city wants a mayor, it seeks one by inquiring
among other cities; sometimes it advertises for
him. It would be quite impossible, of course, for
our cities to advertise for mayors, not that there
would be any lack of applicants, since everyone is
considered capable of directing the affairs of a city
in this country. Of course everyone is not capable;
few of the persons chosen are capable at the time
they are chosen. Many of them become very capable
after they have had experience, but they gain this
experience at the expense of the public, and about
the time they have gained it, their services are dispensed
with, and a new incompetent accidentally
succeeds them.</p>

<p>The condition is due partly to the fact that we
are of a tradition that is concerned with governing
exclusively, and not administering; our conception
is of an executive, a kind of lieutenant or subaltern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
of the sovereign power, and in our proverbial fear
and jealousy of kings we see that he does not have
too much power or develop those powers he has by a
long tenure of office.</p>

<p>The officials of a German city are pure administrators,
and nothing else; they are not governors
or censors. They are not charged in fact with police
powers at all. And if they were, they would
not have questions of such delicacy to meet, for the
police there are for the purpose of protecting life
and property, and they are not expected to regulate
the personal conduct and refine the morals of the
community, or to rear the young. They have not
confused their functions with the <i>censores mores</i> of
old Rome, or like us, with the beadles of New England
villages of colonial times. That is, the Puritan
spirit is not known there, at least in the intensified
acerbity in which it exists with us; moral problems,
oddly enough, are left to parents, teachers or pastors.
The police over there are generally a part of
the military organizations. It would be better of
course, to bear the ills we have than to transplant
any military system to our soil, for state police in
America would become mere Cossacks employed to
keep the laboring population in subjection. But if
the state is to undertake to regulate the moral conduct
of the inhabitants of cities, it should provide all
the means of regulation and take all the responsibility,
including the onus of violating the democratic
principle. If the state is to regenerate the land by
the machinery of morals police, it should have its
own morals police, tell them just how to proceed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
compel the inhabitants of cities to be moral, and pay
them out of the state treasury.</p>

<p>It is, however, a curious characteristic of our
people, or of the vocal minority of them, that while
they insist on every possible interference with every
private and personal right, in the field of moral
conduct, they nevertheless will tolerate no interference
whatever with property rights. Thus it was
precisely as Cossacks that many employers of labor
insisted on my using the police to cow their workmen
whenever there was a strike.</p>

<p>During my first term it befell that our city was
torn by strikes, all the union machinists in town
walked out, then the moulders, and at last a great
factory wherein automobiles were made was
&#8220;struck,&#8221; as the workingmen say. It is impossible
to give an idea of the worry such a condition causes
officials. It is more than that sensation of weariness,
of irritation, even of disgust, which it causes
the general public. This is due partly to the resentment
created by the interference with physical
comfort, and even peace of mind, since there
is in us all something more than a fear of disorder
and tumult, in that innate love of harmony which
exists potentially in humanity. But to the official
there is a greater difficulty because of the responsibility
to which he is held. People intuitively regard
strikers as public enemies, and while the blame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
for the irritation caused by strikes is visited on the
direct and apparent cause, that is, the strikers themselves;
it is visited, too, on the official head of the
local government, who is supposed to be able somehow
to put a stop to such things. The general or
mass intelligence will not as yet go much deeper
than the superfices of the problem, or seek to understand
the causes of economic unrest and disorder;
it still thinks in old sequences and puts its trust in
the weapons of the flesh.</p>

<p>I think I shall never forget the first call I had
from a delegation of manufacturers during the early
days of those strikes. They came in not too friendly
spirit, but rather in their capacity of &#8220;citizens
and tax-payers,&#8221; standing on their rights, as they
understood them, though they in common with
most of us and with the law as well, had only
the most hazy notions as to what those rights
were, and perhaps still hazier notions as to their
duties. &#8220;We come,&#8221; said the spokesman, &#8220;representing
two millions of dollars&#8217; worth of property.&#8221;</p>

<p>They could not have put their case more frankly.
But I, as I was able to recall in that moment, represented
two hundred thousand people, themselves
among them of course. And here at the very outset
was the old conflict in its simplest terms, of man
against property. Now, in that old struggle, while I
had made no sacrifices in the cause and have been of
no especial service in it, I had nevertheless given intellectual
assent to the general propositions advanced
in favor of the human side, the side of man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
By prejudice, or perversity, or constitutionally, I
considered men of more value than factories. I had
perhaps never heard of a strike, for instance, in
which my sympathies were not impulsively with the
strikers. I could always see that poor foreigner,
whose body had lain there on the cold damp rocks
at Lemont so many years before, and somehow I
could not get out of my mind&#8217;s eye the figures of
the workmen on strike, many of them hungry and
desperate as their wives and children were; they
seemed to me to be in straits more dire than their
harried and harassed and worried employers, though
I could feel sorry for them, too, since even if they
were not hungry, they, too, were the victims of the
anarchy of our industrial system. They had of
course no social conscience whatever, but perhaps
they could not help that. But there they were,
bringing their troubles to the mayor, whom perhaps
they did not wholly regard as their mayor, since
they had some prescience of the fact that in that
mayor&#8217;s mind was always the memory of those
throngs of workingmen who had looked up to him
with some of the emotions of confidence and hope.
There was alas little enough that he could do for
those workingmen, but, especially in such an hour,
he must at least not forget them. Of the relative
rights of their present quarrel he had little knowledge;
but he had envisaged enough of life to know,
without too much sentimentalizing them, that, while
they were often wrong, they were somehow right
when they were wrong. That is, their eternal cause
was right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>What the manufacturers wanted, as they put it,
was &#8220;protection,&#8221; a term with vague and varying
connotations. As was the case in all the strikes of
all the years of my experience in the mayoralty, they
felt that the police were not sufficiently aggressive,
or that the Chief of Police had not detailed sufficient
men to afford them protection. I did not raise the
question, though it occurred to me, as to what the
police were doing to protect the strikers, who were
citizens, too, and tax-payers, or at least rent-payers
and so indirect tax-payers, but when I asked the
Chief, the big-hearted Perry Knapp reported that
the strikers were complaining, too, and out of his
collection of works on Lincoln, he brought me one
which contained a letter the great president wrote
to General John M. Schofield, when he assigned that
officer to the command of the Department of the Missouri,
in May, 1863, to succeed General Curtis.
Curtis had been the head of one party as Governor
Gamble had been the head of the other, in what
Lincoln called the pestilent factional quarrel into
which the Union men had entered. &#8220;Now that you
are in the position,&#8221; wrote Lincoln, &#8220;I wish you to
undo nothing merely because General Curtis or Governor
Gamble did it, but to exercise your own judgment,
and do right for the public interest. Let your
military measures be strong enough to repel the invader
and keep the peace, and not so strong as to
unnecessarily harass and persecute the people. It is
a difficult r&ocirc;le, and so much the greater will be the
honor if you perform it well. If both factions, or
neither, shall abuse you, you will probably be about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
right. Beware of being assailed by one and praised
by the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>How Lincoln knew human nature! It seemed as
good a model as one might find, since we, too, were
in the midst of a little civil war, and we always tried
to pursue that course. What the manufacturing
employers wished, of course, was for us to use the
police to break the strike; that we did not deem
it our duty to do. What we tried to do was to
preserve the public peace and&mdash;since our industry
in its present status is war&mdash;to let them fight it
out. We tried to see to it that they fought it out
along the lines laid down, in fixing the relative rights
of the industrial belligerents, by the Courts of Great
Britain, and this policy had the virtual approval of
our own courts when in an ancillary way it came
under discussion there. But we had difficulty in
maintaining the peace, not only because the strikers,
or more likely their sympathizers, broke it now
and then, but because when the strikers were not
breaking it, the employers seemed bent on doing
something to make them. They did not intend it
for that purpose of course; they simply thought in
old feudal sequences. They hired mercenaries, bullies
provided as &#8220;guards&#8221; by private detective agencies.
It kept the police pretty busy disarming these
guards, and greatly added to their labors because
the guards were always on the point of hurting some
one.</p>

<p>There was one of the employers, indeed, who grew
so alarmed that he came one morning to the office
predicting a riot at his plant, that very afternoon at
five o&#8217;clock, when the works were to shut down for
the day. This man was just then operating his
factory with strike breakers and he was concerned
for their safety. Indeed his concern was expressed
in the form of a personal sympathy and love for
them which was far more sentimental than any I
had ever been accused of showing toward workingmen.
He was concerned about their inalienable
right to work, and about their wives and little children,
and about their comfort and peace of mind;
indeed it was such a concern, such a love, that, had
he but shown the moiety of it to his former employees,
they never could have gone out on strike at all.</p>

<p>At five o&#8217;clock that day then, with the Chief of
Police, I visited the plant to observe, and if possible
to prevent the impending riot. The works had
not yet closed for the day, but in the street before
the black and haggard and ugly buildings where
they had toiled, the strikers were gathered, and with
them their wives, with bare and brawny forearms
rolled in their aprons, and their children clinging
timorously about their skirts. It was a gray and
somber afternoon in spring, but there was in the
crowd a kind of nervous excitement that might have
passed for gayety, a mood that strangely travestied
the holiday spirit; perhaps they regarded the strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
as an opportunity for the sensation lacking in their
monotonous lives. There were several hulking fellows
loafing about whom the Chief of Police recognized
as private detectives, and as a first step in
preventing disorder, he ordered these away. Presently
the whistle blew its long, lugubrious blast,
the crowd gathered in closer groups, and a silence
fell. Sitting there with the Chief in his official
buggy, I waited; the great gates of the high
stockade swung slowly open, and then there issued
forth a vehicle, the like of which I had never seen
before, a sort of huge van, made of rough boards,
that might have moved the impedimenta of an embassy.
In the rear there was a door, fastened with
a padlock; the sides were pierced with loop holes,
and on the high seat beside the driver sat an enormous
guard, with a rifle across his knees. This van,
this moving arsenal containing within its mysterious
interior the strike breakers, and I was told other
guards ready to thrust rifles through those loop
holes, moved slowly out of those high gates, lurched
across the gutter into the street, and rumbled away,
and as it went it was followed by a shout of such
ridicule that even the guard on the front seat lost
his menacing gravity and smiled himself, perhaps
with some dawning recognition of the absurdity of
the whole affair.</p>

<p>There was no riot, though when the employer came
to see me the next day I could assure him of my
surprise that there had been none, since there was
an invitation to disorder almost irresistible in that
solemn and absurd vehicle, with its rifles and loop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
holes and guards and cowering mystery within. And
I could urge upon him too a belated recognition of
the immutable and unwritten law by which such an
invitation to trouble is sure to be accepted. I almost
felt, I told him, like heaving a stone after it
myself to see what would happen. He finally agreed
with me, dismissed his guards, and dismantled his
rolling arsenal, and not long afterward was using
its gear to haul the commodities they were soon
manufacturing in those shops again.</p>

<p>And the strikes in the other plants were settled
or compromised, or wore themselves out, or in some
way got themselves ended, though not the largest
and most ominous of them, that in the automobile
works, until my friend Mr. Marshall Sheppey and I
had worked seventy-two hours continuously to get
the leaders of the opposing sides together. It was an
illuminating experience for both of us, and not without
its penalties, since thereafter we were called
upon to arbitrate a dozen other strikes. We found
both sides rather alike in their humanness, and one
as unreasonable as the other, but we found too that
if we could keep them together long enough, their
own reason somehow prevailed and they reached
those fragile compromises which are the most we
may expect in the present status of productive industry
in this world.</p>

<p>The old shop of Golden Rule Jones had its strike
with the rest of them, and yet a strange and significant
fate befell it. Alone of all the other shops
and factories in the city involved in that strike,
it was not picketed by the strikers, they did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
even visit it, so far as I know. There were no guards
and no policemen needed. And when I asked one
of the labor leaders to account for this strange
oversight, this surprising lack of solidarity and discipline
in their ranks, he said, as though he must
exculpate himself: &#8220;Oh well, you know&mdash;Mayor
Jones. We haven&#8217;t forgotten him and what he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was because of this attitude toward workingmen,
and their cause, that I was accused, now and
then, by those who knew nothing about Socialism,
of being a Socialist; by those who did know about
it I was condemned for not being one. Our movement
indeed had no opponents in the town more bitter
than the Socialists, that is the authentic and
orthodox Socialists of the class-conscious Marxist
order, and they opposed me so insistently that I
might as well have been the capitalist class and had
done with it. I do not intend to confuse myself
with the movement of which I, for a while, was but
the merest and weakest of human instruments; I
speak in that personal sense only because the opposition
was of a personal quality so intense that
it could hardly have been expected of an attitude
that was always insisted upon as so entirely impersonal,
the cold and scientific attitude of minds that
had comprehended the whole of human history, analyzed
the whole amazing complexity of human life,
and reduced its problems to that degree in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
they were all to be solved by a formula so brief that
it could be printed on a visiting card. The complaint
these scientists made of our movement was
that its ameliorations in city life were retarding
that evolution of which they were the inspired custodians
and conservators; some of them spoke of it
as though it were but a darkling part of that vast
conspiracy against mankind in which the capitalists
were so shamelessly engaged. If we had only let
things alone, it was urged, they might grow so desperate
that no one but the Socialists would be capable
of dealing with the appalling situation.</p>

<p>But this was the attitude only of that coterie
which, unselfishly, no doubt, with the purest of motives,
and only until the industrial democracy could
be organized and rendered sufficiently class-conscious
to take over the work, was directing the destinies of
the Socialist party, very much to the fleshly eye in
the same manner that the Republican machine controlled
that party or the Democratic machine its
party, or, before we were done, certain persons
attempted to control the Independent movement.
So far as I could discern, there was not much
difference in them all; the Socialists seemed to
rely on all the old weapons that had so long been
employed in the world, and so long failed; they
seemed to contemplate nothing more than replacement
of old orthodoxies with new, old tyrannies
with new tyrannies; in a word, to preserve the old
vicious circle in which humanity has been revolving
impotently and stupidly down all the grooves of
time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>I could not have been a Socialist because life had
somehow taught me that this is a world of relativities,
in which the absolute is the first impossibility.
I could share, of course, their hope, or the hope of
some of them in a well ordered society, though with
many of them the dream seemed to be beautiful
chiefly because they expected to order it themselves;
they who felt themselves so long to have been the
slaves were to become the masters; their hard and too
logical theory of classes circumscribed their vision
so that they could imagine nothing more clearly,
and possibly nothing more delightful than a bouleversement
which would leave them on top.</p>

<p>I could recognize with them the masters under
whom we all alike were serving in this land, and
respect them as little as we might, or detest them
as we would, they presented whatever advantage
there is in familiarity; if nothing more inviting than
a change in masters were proposed, one would prefer
those one had to others whose habits and whims he
did not know. One could be pretty sure that the
new masters would use the same old whips and
scorpions, or if new ones, with a sting more bitter.
They proposed as much, indeed, in their rigid form
of organization, with a discipline more irksome and
relentless, what with their signing of pledges, and
their visitations and committees of inspection, and
trials for heresy and excommunications. They reminded
me of those prosecutors who could behold
no defect in the penal machinery save that it had
not been sufficiently drastic; they would replace all
old intolerances and ancient tyrannies by others no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
different save that they were employed in the opposing
cause, and were to be even more intolerant
and tyrannical.</p>

<p>That is, the Socialists provided for everything in
the world except liberty, and to one whose dissolving
illusions had left nothing but the dream of liberty
in a world where liberty was not and probably
never was to be, there was no allure in the proposal
to take away even the dream of liberty.</p>

<p>None of them of course would be impressed by
these objections&mdash;was not the great cure for social
ill written and printed on a card?&mdash;nor would
they consider them even until they had been submitted
to the prescribed test of a joint debate, about
the most futile device ever adopted by mankind, and
a nuisance as offensive as any that ever disturbed
society. It was of course the only amusement they
had, as popular as running the gauntlet was with
the Indians, and they liked to torture a capitalist to
make a Socialist holiday. It is of course quite useless
to argue with one who is always right, one whose
utterances have the authority of revealed truth, but
inasmuch as society had not yet been developed to a
point of communal efficiency sufficient to keep the
streets clean, it seemed idle to undertake the communal
control of production and distribution. And
however wrong I may be in every other thing, I am
quite sure that I am right in this, that in their analysis
of society they have failed utterly to take into
account that classic of the ironic spirit, the great
law of the contrariety of things, according to which
the expected never happens, at least in the way it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
was expected to happen, and nothing ever turns
out the way it was planned.</p>

<p>But there is a more fundamental law&mdash;that of
the destructive power of force, which always defeats
itself. For their reliance was on force&mdash;and how
quietly they, or the most virile of them, entered upon
their last phase in their acceptance of the doctrine
of force as preached now everywhere by the I. W. W.
agitator on the curbstone! Sometimes after all the
law does not take a thousand years to work itself
out.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the single-taxers had a
scheme far better than that of the Socialists, since
they suggested a reliance on the democratic, and
not on the authoritarian theory, though in its mysterious
progress, in its constant development of new
functions, democracy may be expected to modify
even that theory. I fear at least that it would not
do away with mosquitoes; possibly not even with reformers.</p>

<p>But I would not be unfair, and I counted many
friends among the Socialists of my town and time
whose best ideals one could gladly share. They were
immensely intelligent, or immensely informed; they
had made a fairly valid indictment against society
as it is organized, or disorganized. But like Mr.
H. G. Wells, who calls himself a Socialist, these exceptions,
in Mr. Wells&#8217;s words, were by no means
fanatical or uncritical adherents. To them as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
him Socialism was a noble, and yet a very human and
fallible system of ideas. To them, as, again to him,
it was an intellectual process, a project for the reshaping
of human society upon new and better lines&mdash;the
good will of the race struggling to make
things better. This broad and tolerant view was
the one to which they held, though they seemed too
closely to identify all the good will in the race, operating,
as I believe it to be, in many ways and
through many agencies, as Socialism, and the pontifical
Socialism taught in our town, at least, was so
explicitly a class hatred that most of the time it
was anything in the world rather than good will.
Anyone with a good heart could be a Socialist on
Mr. Wells&#8217;s terms, if it were not his inevitable fate
to be assured by the orthodox custodians of the
party faith, the high priests who alone could enter
the holy of holies and bear forth, as occasion required,
the ark of the covenant, that Mr. Wells&#8217;s
Socialism is no Socialism at all and that he is no
man to consult or accept.</p>

<p>My friends among them were like him in the condemnation
they had to hear from the machine, or,
perhaps I should say, the governing or directing
committee&mdash;whatever the euphemism that cloaks
the familiar phenomenon with them&mdash;they too were
said to be no Socialists at all; they were mere &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;
or &#8220;sentimentalists,&#8221; or easily fell into
some other of the categories the Socialists have provided
for every manifestation of life. They have
doubtless rendered society a service by their minute
classification; which seems complete if they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
only recognize the order of the sectarian mind, and
since the orthodox among them afford so typical an
example, include themselves in it. I am not sure that
it is not quite as distinct a species as the capitalist
class itself, at least it causes as much trouble in
the world as the Socialists say the capitalist class
creates. Socialists, at least of the impossibilist wing,
evangelists, prohibitionists, Puritans, policemen and
most of the rest of the reformers are endowed with
this order of mind. While they all form subdivisions
of a distinct intellectual class of humanity
these are generally the same. That is, they are, all
of them, always under all circumstances, right. All
of these classes, fundamentally, follow the same sequences
of thought. They differ of course in minor
details, but they always meet on that narrow strip
of ground upon which they have erected their inflexible
model for humanity, with just room enough
by its side for the scaffold upon which to hang those
who do not accept it.</p>

<p>Now, when, by any coincidence, the representatives
of any two of these species meet in the mistaken supposition
that there is any disagreement between
them, there is bound to be trouble of course, and
whenever say a Socialist of the impossibilist wing
of the party, and a policeman&mdash;and all good policemen
are impossibilists&mdash;meet, we have posited
the old problem in physics of an irresistible body
meeting an impenetrable substance.</p>

<p>This phenomenon occurred on two or three occasions
when policemen interfered with Socialists
speaking in the streets. I am sure the Socialists in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
question could have regretted the circumstance no
more than I, for if there was one right which I
tried to induce the police to respect, it was the
right of free speech. On the whole they did fairly
well, and at a time when there seemed to be an epidemic
of ferocity among municipal officials in the
land that led them to all sorts of unwarranted interferences
with human and constitutional rights, we
had folk of all sorts preaching their strange doctrines
in our streets&mdash;Republicans, Democrats, Socialists,
of their several sorts, I. W. W.&#8217;s, evangelists,
anarchists, suffragists, Mormons, Salvationists,
to say nothing of all the religious sects; wisdom was
veritably crying in the streets. Emma Goldman,
during that period of hysteria when the advent of
that little woman in a city precipitated a siege of
fear, delivered her course of lectures in Toledo to
audiences that were very small, since there were no
police to insure the attendance of those who were
interested more in sensations than in her philosophic
discussions of the German drama. And we tried
to respect the rights of all.</p>

<p>But it is one thing to give orders, and another to
have them implicitly obeyed. Those of the indurated
sectarian mind, who would order all life by mechanism,
are given to saying that if they were in authority
the police would do so and so, and would not do
such and such a thing, that they would have the
police see to this and that, etc., etc., etc. After
they had been in power a while they would grow
humble, if not discouraged, and, like me, be gratified
if they succeeded in accomplishing about one-third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
of what they had hoped and planned to accomplish.
Thus I, who had tried to give everybody
the right of free speech, was now and then chagrined
to find that someone had been interfered with for
preaching some new heresy.</p>

<p>The right of free speech cherished by all and exercised
by none, since, owing to a disposition on
the part of humanity to apply the hemlock or the
noose in such cases, few say what they actually
think, is one which certain of the Socialists preferred
to have honored in the breach rather than in
the observance. They would be never so happy,
never so much in their element as when their address
was interrupted; the greater the interference, the
more acute the suffering for the cause, and when a
man begins to feel that there is in him the blood of
the martyrs, which, as he has heard somewhere, is the
seed of the churches, why, of course, he is in such
an exalted state of mind that there is no human way
of dealing with him.</p>

<p>And then that strange human spark, that mysterious
thing we call personality, is always there&mdash;that
element which makes impossible any perfectly
or ideally organized state, social or otherwise. It
is assumed by those of the order of mind under notice
that it is possible so to organize human affairs
that they will work automatically, with the precision
of a machine, that they will work just as they are
intended to work and in no other way, that it is,
indeed, impossible for them to work in any other
way, and that it may be predicted long in advance
exactly how they will work at any given instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
and under any exigency, or circumstance. This, of
course, is impossible, as everybody knows, except
the impossibilists. That is why they are impossibilists.</p>

<p>These speakers, however, who would dehumanize
everything yet cannot after all dehumanize themselves,
would frequently court arrest in the belief
that the meed of pseudo-martyrdom thereby made
possible was an ornament to their cause, and they
would often try the patience of officers, who like the
speakers themselves and all of us, are unfortunately,
or perhaps fortunately, only human. Thus a Socialist
speaker standing on his soap box, in the course of
his remarks, indulged in certain reflections on the
police as an institution. His sentiments in that respect
were not perhaps heterodox, from the standpoint
of my own orthodoxy, but we had been trying
to create <i>esprit de corps</i> in the police department,
and the policeman on that beat chancing to
arrive at that inauspicious moment, and viewing life
from an altitude less lofty and impersonal than the
Socialist claimed for his outlook, took the scientific
statements of the Socialist not in the academic sense,
but as a personal reflection upon the body of which
he, it seems, was growing rather proud of being a
member, and at the conclusion of the effort he privately
informed the speaker that if he said anything
more against the Toledo Police Department he would
&#8220;knock his block off.&#8221; He was reprimanded by his
lieutenant, even after he had explained that he intended
to execute his rude intention in his private
and not in his official capacity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>The incident could be represented by the Socialists
as a veritable reflection of the views of the administration
on the important subject of Socialism,
but they could not derive quite the satisfaction from
it they had in another incident, or accident, which
befell the most prominent and authoritative of their
local leaders. He was speaking one evening in a
crowded street, when he had the good fortune to be
arrested by a captain of police. He made the occasion
the opportunity for an edifying debate, and
lingered as long as the captain would let him; but,
in the end, was led to the police headquarters. This
was the irresistible meeting the impenetrable. While
everybody had a right to speak his mind in the
streets, everybody else, we felt, had an equal right
not to listen, even to free speech, and the police
had orders to keep the streets and sidewalks clear
for traffic. Now this captain was a chap who carried
out orders given to him, and, as he was in
command of the traffic squad, traffic was his specialty.
If streets were to be cleared, then, in his
philosophy, they were to be cleared, and no little
thing like a constitutional inhibition against the
abridgment of human speech would stand in his way.
And then, after all, police are more apt to arrest
people they do not like than those they do, and
no one likes those who disagree with him. But after
the arrest, the offender is turned out without chances
of reparation. In this instance, feeling that the Socialist
had had an indignity put upon him by his
arrest, while I could not undo what had been done,
I could order his release and tender him an official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
apology in writing, which was accepted, though not
acknowledged. And an order was issued that a
policemen who thereafter interfered with any voice
crying in the wilderness should be dismissed from
the department.</p>

</div>


<p>As a boy, thirty years ago, I used to observe,
with a boy&#8217;s interest, the little bob-tailed street cars
that went teetering and tinkling, at intervals of
half an hour, out a long street that ran within a
block of my home. I watched the cars intently, and
so intently that the impressions of their various
colors, sounds and smells have remained with me
to this day, speaking, in a way, of the conditions
of a small American city of that time, and affording
a means by which to measure that progress in material
efficiency which is so often mistaken for progress
in speculative thought.</p>

<p>It may have been that my interest was intensified
by the fact that down in Urbana Street cars
were unknown, though they were not unimagined,
since we used to see them when we went to Cincinnati,
and I could then, and I can still, recall, though
time has softened the poignancy of that hour, the
pain of parting with a certain noble horse which
my father sold to a man of dark and hateful aspect,
and of the morsel of comfort I derived from the
stipulation, invalid enough to be sure, my father
made with the dealer, that the horse was not to be
put to street-car service. That, by my father, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
so by me myself, was held to be the most cruel, degrading
and ignoble fate that could befall a horse.
But another reason for my interest was the possession
of a curiosity to which the passing show has
always been novel, generally amusing, sometimes
pleasing and often saddening, too&mdash;a curiosity in
life which I hope will endure fresh and wholesome
until life&#8217;s largest curiosity shall be satisfied at the
end of life.</p>

<p>The progress of the little street car under notice
was leisurely and deliberate, sometimes it would
wait obligingly for a woman, half a block away, who
hurried puffing, and fluttering, and waving, to reach
the street corner, and when she had clambered
aboard, the driver would slowly unwind his brake,
cluck to his horse, the rope traces would strain
and the car would bowl along. Ten blocks away
from the business section, or a few blocks further
on, the little car with its five windows and small
hooded platform would enter upon a bare, though
expectant scene of vacant lots, and about a mile
out, where there was some lonely dwelling staring
blankly and reproachfully as though it had been
misled, and then abandoned, and further on a few
small, expectant cottages, the long, low street-car
barn was reached, the car was driven on to a little
turntable, slowly turned about and started back.
Sometimes, if I was lucky, I had a chance to witness
the change of horses, and to experience a nebulous
pity for the nag that ambled contentedly into the
stable, and did not seem to be very tired after all.</p>

<p>On Summit Street there were grander cars, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
drawn by two horses, and there were other lines in
town, each with its cars painted a distinguishing
color. There was one line that went out Collingwood
Avenue, far to the very country itself; its cars
bowled under noble trees and even past a stately
mansion or two, or what in those days seemed stately
mansions, and it was pleasant, it was even musical,
to hear the tinkle of the bell on the horse&#8217;s collar.
Then there was still another line that ran down the
broad Maumee River, almost to Maumee Bay and
the &#8220;marsh&#8221; where the French <i>habitants</i> lived, and
spoke delightfully like the people in Dr. Drummond&#8217;s
poems. On Saturday mornings my father was likely
to send me on an errand to a superannuated clergyman
who lived down there, and this involved a long,
irritating journey. The journey occupied the whole
morning, and spoiled a holiday. And then it was
always cold, for, in the not too clear retrospect, I
seem to have been sent on this particular errand
only in winter, and the car was the coldest place in
the world, especially when it got down where the
winds from the icy lake could strike it. Its floor
was strewn recklessly with yellow straw, in some
ironical pretense of keeping the car warm, and I
would sit there with feet slowly freezing in the
rustling straw, and after I had inspected the
two or three passengers, there was nothing to
do but to read the notice over the fare-box in
the front end of the car, until I had it quite by
heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;The driver will furnish change to the amount of
Two Dollars, returning the full amount, thus enabling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
the passenger to put the exact fare in the
box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I could peer up toward the fare-box and
look at the one nickel stranded half-way down its
zig-zag chute, and look at the driver, standing on
the front platform, slowly rocking from one foot to
the other, bundled up in old overcoats, with his cap
pulled down and his throat and chin muffled in a repulsive
woolen scarf, hoary with the frost of his
breath, and nothing of him visible except the shining
red point of his frosted nose. His hands, one holding
the reins, the other the brake-handle, were lost
in the various strata of mittens that marked epochs
co-extensive with those of the several overcoats. I
had read once in a newspaper of a street-car driver
in Indianapolis who, at the end of his run, never
moved, but kept right on standing there, and when
the barn-boss swore at him, it was found that he
was dead, frozen at his post. And I sometimes wondered,
as I dwelt on that fascinating horror, if it
were possible that sometime, when the car reached
the bay, this driver would not be found frozen.
Sometimes I expected to be found frozen myself,
but nothing exciting ever happened on that journey,
and so, somehow, the trips out other streets and
other avenues in other cars, remain more pleasantly
in the memory, associated with the sunshine and
the leafy arch of green overhead, with something of
the romance and mystery of untraveled roads in the
long vista ahead, while the winter trip down to the
superannuated clergyman&#8217;s is cold and bleak and
desolate, perhaps because it had no more interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
result than the few minutes I begrudged in that
stiff little &#8220;parlor,&#8221; where the preacher received me
with the not unkindly regard of eyes that had the
dazed expression of the very old. I can expiate the
perfectly patent and impolite reluctance with which
I visited the aged man, and the thoughtless contempt
youth has for age itself, only by the hope that
those dim eyes have since brightened at the realization
of those glories they had so long foreseen,
which formed perhaps the only consolation of a life
that must have had little to gladden it on that forbidding
spot.</p>

<p>All these lines, and others like them in the
sprawling young town, belonged each to different
men, and once I happened to hear that the man who
owned the line first mentioned say that every new
family that moved into that thoroughfare or built
a house there, meant $73.00 a year to him. A good
many families moved out into that street, enough
indeed to make a settlement that was a town in itself,
growing and spreading at the end of the line. Gradually
the gaunt vacancies between were built up,
though not, it appears, until the man had grown
discouraged and sold out, and so suffered the universal
fate of the pioneer. One by one the other
lines in town were sold, and finally a day came when
all the lines were owned by a certain few men, who
under our purely individualistic legal system, formed
a company and thus could jointly rejoice in all the
individual rights and privileges of a person, without
any of his embarrassing moral duties and responsibilities.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>I ceased to hear of the individual owner any
more; I never saw him in his shirt-sleeves in his little
office at the end of the line counting up the nickels
of those new families which each meant $73.00 per
annum to him, and it must have been about the
same time that I began to hear of the traction company.
There had been probably intervening experiments
with tough mules, whom no one pitied, as
everyone had pitied the horses they replaced, and
there were, in other cities, astounding miracles of
cable cars and elevated railways. And then electricity
came as a motive power, and the streets
were made hideous by the gaunt poles and makeshifts
of wires, and the trolley cars came, and
increased in size and numbers, and families swarmed,
until out on those streets and avenues the great
yellow cars went rushing and clanging by, with multitudes
of people clinging to the straps and, toward
evening, swarming like flies on the broad rear platforms,
and the conductors in their blue uniforms
shouting &#8220;Step lively!&#8221; with a voice as authoritative
as that which the company spoke in the city
councils. And the families continued to arrive, and
to build houses, and to toil and to contribute each
its $73.00 a year, though they did it with human
reluctance and complaint, and grew dimly conscious
that somewhere in the whole complicated transaction
an injustice lurked. And finally this hidden injustice
became the chief public concern of the people
of the town, and an issue in local politics for more
than a decade.</p>

<p>It had been an issue, as I have more than once
said in Jones&#8217;s time and in his campaigns, though
the issues his tremendous personality raised were
so vast and so general and so fundamental that
they included all issues, as Emerson said his reform
included all reforms. It ran like a scarlet thread
through the warp and woof of our communal life;
it was somehow associated with the ambitions of
the meanest politician, it affected the fortunes of
every man in business, and it was the means whereby
the community came to have an ideal. The long
story of it, like the story of the same interest in
any town, would include triumphs and tragedies&mdash;and
the way of politics through the town was strewn
with the pitiable wrecks of character and of life
itself that had been ruthlessly sacrificed to the insatiable
greed of privilege. Only the other day one
such wreck, once in a position of honor and trust in
the municipality, was waiting in the outer office;
he wanted half a dollar and a place to sleep. And
another like him, most desperate of all, asked to be
committed to a city hospital or even to the asylum
for the insane; he had no other refuge, and as for
the poorhouse, he said, not yet, not yet! And
these were the sacrifices privilege demanded of its
parasites; though their case morally, at least, could
be no worse than that of privilege&#8217;s principal beneficiaries;
not half so bad indeed, since they had lost
the power of appreciation of spiritual values.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>I knew a reporter, an Irish lad, whom one of the
attorneys of privilege sought to &#8220;befriend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You work pretty hard, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked the
attorney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Irish lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your salary is small?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a mortgage on your mother&#8217;s home?&#8221; The
agents of privilege always know a man&#8217;s necessities!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I can tell you how things can be eased
up a bit for you. For instance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>After the proposal had been artfully made,
the Irish lad thought a moment, and then he raised
those blue eyes to the old lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife is prominent socially, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;President of&mdash;this and that, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your daughters just home from a finishing
school in Europe, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but what&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering,&#8221; said the Irish lad, rising,
&#8220;how you dared go home at night and look &#8217;em in
the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not all men though have the character, the moral
resistance of that Irish lad, and the scores of the
weak and erring ones are the tragic figures in the
long drama of the traction company in the city,
in any city&mdash;the drama that cannot be written.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the education of the general mind
went on, and we were, after all, tending somewhither.
Our experience in the greatest of our tasks demonstrated
that, and in the change that gradually took
place in sentiment concerning the street railway
problem, there was an evidence of the development
of a mass consciousness, a mass will, which some
time in these cities of ours will justify democracy.
It is of course the most difficult process in the world,
for a mass of two hundred thousand people to unite
in the expression of a will concerning a single abstract
proposition. The mass to be sure can now
and then as it were rear its head and blaze forth
wrath and accomplish some instant work of destruction;
even if it be nothing more than the destruction
of an individual reputation. That is why the recall
is so popular and so generously and frequently employed
in those cities that have it. In such elections,
with their personal and human center of interest, the
people all turn out, while in a referendum involving
some abstract principle, the vote cast is always
small. That is why the referendum is so important,
and the recall, relatively, so unimportant; the use
of the first in the long run will afford a fine schooling
for the people.</p>

<p>The most familiar expression of this rage of
course was the clamor for the indictment and imprisonment
of someone connected in sinister ways
with the company, a demand with which I never had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
the slightest sympathy, to which I could never
yield the slightest acquiescence. What good, though
all the poor and miserable servitors of privilege
were put in prison, while privilege itself remained?
Such clamors have had their results; a few more
broken lives, a little more sorrow and shame in the
world, and the clamor ceases, and things go on the
same as before.</p>

<p>It is this instability, this variableness, this weariness
of the public mind, on which privilege depends,
with a cynical trust so often justified that it might
breed cynicism in all observant and reflective natures.
The street railway proprietors in Toledo
expected each election to demonstrate this weariness
in the people, and to restore them to, or at least
confirm them in, the privileges they had enjoyed
under the old r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>For a people to assume and for a decade consistently
to maintain an attitude toward a public
question therefore was a triumph of the democratic
principle. That is what the people of Cleveland
did; that is what the people of Detroit did; that
is what the people of Toledo did. The successive
stages of this process were most interesting to observe,
the more especially since they caught in the
movement even some of the street railway group
and its political confreres themselves.</p>

<p>In its origin the public will was destructive no
doubt, that was the inarticulate disgust born of the
long endurance of inadequate service, all the miseries
of that contemptuous exploitation of the
people so familiar in all the cities of America. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
this, on the customary revelations of a corrupt domination
of the political machinery of the city by the
street railway company, there was added a moral
rage&mdash;the one element needed to provide the spark
for the mine. At first this rage against the company
was such that any action taken by officials was popular
so long as it injured or harassed or was
somehow inimical to the company. And in consequence
there was developed a kind of local jingoism
or chauvinism; whenever popularity slackened or it
was felt necessary to remind the electorate back in
the ward of the sleepless vigilance of their representative
in the council, a councilman had only to introduce
some resolution that would be against the
company&#8217;s interest. It was unfortunate, and had its
evil phase, as any suggestion of intellectual dishonesty
must ever have, and it made serious dealing
with the subject extremely difficult and hazardous.
It was difficult to recognize any of the company&#8217;s
rights; and it was always at the risk of misunderstanding,
and with the certainty of misrepresentation
that this was done. But of course it was
necessary to do this, in the course of the long and
complicated transaction, that constant and inflexible
opposition of the public with the private interest
which now assumed the aspect of a noisy and
furious war, and now the softer phases of diplomatic
negotiations. Of course there were always those
in town who knew exactly what was to be done; they
could settle the vexatious problem with a facile gesture,
between the whiffs of a cigarette on the back
platform of a street car, or in an after dinner speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
between the puffs of a cigar. The one was apt
to advise that the &#8220;traction company be brought
to time at once,&#8221; the other that an &#8220;equitable&#8221; settlement
be &#8220;arranged&#8221; by conservative business
men. Meanwhile the problem obviously consisted
in the necessity of recognizing the private right in
the proprietors and of securing the public right to
the people, and to do this it was necessary to search
out, and isolate, like some malignant organism, the
injustice that somewhere lurked in this complex and
irritating association.</p>

<p>In my first campaign we proposed to grant no
renewal of franchises at a rate of fare higher than
three cents. Jones had advised it, and I had been
committed to it long before. It was Tom Johnson&#8217;s
old slogan, and it was popular. I used to explain to
the crowds my own conviction that the problem
never would be settled until we had municipal ownership,
but there was in Toledo in those days very
little sentiment for municipal ownership, and my
conviction met with no applause, and was received
only with mild toleration. In the second campaign,
there was more indorsement; in the third there was
a certain enthusiasm for the principle, in the fourth
it seemed to be almost unanimous, and now the principle
has become one of the cardinal articles of
faith. I do not wish it to appear that I had converted
all these people to my view; I had not tried
to do that, and doubtless could not have done so
had I tried, but the conviction came by the very
necessities of the situation.</p>

<p>Those men who ventured early into the street-car
business were pioneers; they assumed large risks, and
they rendered a public service. They had the courage
to undertake experiments; they had faith that
the town would grow and become in time a city.
And they staked all on the chance. They had little
difficulty, if they had any at all, in securing franchises
from the city to use the streets, for the people
of the city were glad to have the convenience of
transportation. Indeed many of the lines were community
enterprises, organized by the men of a given
neighborhood for the sake of the transportation
merely, and not with any notion of personal profit.</p>

<p>Franchise ordinances then were loosely drawn;
men had no conception of what changes the future
was to bring about, they lacked the imagination
to prefigure it, the faith to believe it, and so the
street-car promoters who came along a little later
were the heirs of advantages which otherwise they
would not have obtained. Under these advantages,
these privileges, they or their immediate grantees
were enabled to take over for their own use and
profit the enormous social values that were being
created in cities, not by them, but by all those families
who moved in, and toiled, and wrought and
built the modern city.</p>

<p>This was the first phase of the street-car business,
its experimental stage, commensurate with the
rapid, disordered growth of the city in the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
and western states of America. Few indeed of the
pioneers in the business became wealthy; many no
doubt lost their money, though they tried in vain
to vary or improve their fortunes through the
changes that were rapidly developing the mighty
problem of transporting the crowded populations
of our cities. There were, for instance, the days
when mules were substituted for horses, and sacrificed
rapidly and ruthlessly on the principle that
it was cheaper to replace them than to care for
them, a system about as bad in its consuming cruelty
as that adopted by some factories with reference
to their human employees. Then, in a few of the
larger cities, there were the cable cars, but the
second phase came with the adoption of electricity
as a motive power, and the coincident development,
almost a miracle, of the towns of middle and western
America into real cities.</p>

<p>With electricity as a motive power, and the consequent
cheapening of operation, the street-car business
entered upon its second phase, and it ushered in
at once the era of speculation in franchises and
social values, watered stocks and bonds. The era
of exploitation came upon us, and out of these privileges,
out of other privileges to conduct other public
utilities, i. e., privileges to absorb social values,
enormous fortunes were made, with all the evils that
come with a vulgar, newly-rich plutocracy. To
keep, and extend, and renew these privileges, they
must have their lawyers, and their newspapers to
mislead and debauch the public mind; they must
go into politics, organize and control the machines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
of both parties, bribe councilmen and legislators
and jurors, and even have judges on the bench subservient
to their will, so that the laws of the state
and the grants of the municipality might be construed
in their favor. The sordid, tragic tale of
their domination of municipal politics is now universally
known, and in the tale may be read the
causes of most of our municipal misrule. It happened
in Toledo as it happened everywhere, such is
the inexorability of the general law, and the popular
reaction was the same.</p>

<p>And so we came upon a new, the third stage,
since I have set out to be scientific in analysis of
tractions, and the very name by which these big
enterprises have latterly been called, that is, public
service corporations, suggests the meaning and
indicates the significance of that era. Two facts,
or principles, had become perfectly apparent; first,
that transportation, the primal necessity of a modern
city, is a natural monopoly, and must be
treated as such. Second, that if these public utility
corporations are to continue to hold these monopolies,
they must become public service corporations
indeed, that is, they must serve the public. No more,
then, the old corporation contempt of the people,
at least outwardly expressed, but a softer voice in
addressing them, and a new respect, perhaps grown
sincere. Their old lobbyists disappeared from the
council chamber and the city hall&mdash;for eight years
they were not seen there. The companies had been
primarily profit making institutions and only incidentally
for public service, they were operated for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
the private benefit of their owners in contempt of
public right; the service was secondary.</p>

<p>We may say that this third era is the era of
regulation, or, as it is more apt to be, attempted
regulation, by the city, in which the principle of
the public interest as paramount to the private interest
is to be the basis on which a private company
shall be permitted to operate. This era will endure
long enough to demonstrate itself a failure, the general
mind will continue to learn, to inform itself,
democracy will develop new functions, and we shall
enter on the fourth, and perhaps the final stage,
that of municipal ownership.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">LX</h2>
</div>


<p>We came upon the scene just when the discussion
was emerging from the second into the third
of those phases into which I have divided the development
of the problem. The franchises granted
almost a generation before were about to expire,
and new arrangements between the city and the
traction company, the Big Con, as the newspaper
argot would have it. Chicago had already, or almost,
gone through her settlement; and though the
settlement was pretty bad, it nevertheless recognized
the principle that the value of a street railway
franchise is a public, social, or communal value,
produced by the community, and therefore belonged
to the community. In Toledo the company had but
about $5,000,000 of actual investment, while it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
had a capitalization in stocks and bonds of nearly
$30,000,000, and the difference of $25,000,000 was
the community value which the magnates had been
exploiting for their own benefit. We simply proposed
that this value should be returned to the
people. We proposed, then, that the rate of fare
to be charged by the company should be large
enough and only large enough to pay a reasonable
return on the actual investment and to provide good
service, a service that was to be dictated, regulated
and controlled by the city. This principle had
been established, or at least admitted in the Chicago
settlement, and the same thing had been done,
though on a sounder and more scientific basis in
Cleveland, where Tom Johnson&#8217;s long and gallant
and intelligent contest already in effect had been
won. Over in Detroit the same principles had been
deduced, though the discussion there was so prolonged,
as proved ultimately to be the case in Toledo,
that the people demanded municipal ownership,
without passing through the intervening experimental
stage of regulation and control.</p>

<p>There is of course nothing sacrosanct in three-cent
fares. The movement of the people, which at
the same time, in the old Russian phrase of
Kropotkin, was a movement toward the people, had
become an agitation for this rate. It had been begun
years before by Mayor Pingree in Detroit, and
was taken up in Cleveland by Tom Johnson, whose
whole career in a romantic manner, at once embodied
and illustrated the history of the street
railway problem in the American city. The adoption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
of the phrase as a shibboleth or slogan of the
progressive forces was simply and easily explained,
for in the mind of Johnson and in the minds of those
who were like him or were influenced by him, the
difference between the prevailing fare of five cents
and the proposed fare of three cents somehow measured
the franchise value, or that social value which
belonged to the people. Tom Johnson, indeed, used
often to say that he favored a three-cent fare simply
because it was two cents nearer nothing, thereby
revealing a glimpse of his dream of a social order in
which the municipality would provide transportation
just as it provides sidewalks, sewers, bridges,
etc., all of which are paid for at the treasury in
taxes. It was believed and held by all of us, that
this franchise value should be reclaimed or retained
by the people in this direct and simple manner of
lowering the fare.</p>

<p>There was never any notion, of course, of interfering
in any way with the existing rights of the
company; it was to have all that to which it was
entitled under its old franchises or contracts. But
it was proposed that when we came to draw a new
contract, the political relations of the city and the
company were to be considered as of paramount
importance, using the word &#8220;political,&#8221; of course in
its old authentic sense, and not as expressing in any
wise the sinister thing it has come to connote in the
popular mind. We were determined to meet not only
the conditions of the present, but to do what our
forerunners in office had never done, that is, to protect
the interests of the people of the future. I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
this sounds very much like the trite generalities
of the politician, but we sincerely tried to express
the theory with definiteness and particularity. We
sought not only a reduction of the fare and a regulation
of the service in the public interest, but we
wished to provide for that future day when, as a
result of the certain growth of the city, the sure
improvement in transportation facilities, and the inevitable
development of the democratic function, the
municipality is to undertake these enterprises as a
proper public function.</p>

<p>It was these principles we tried to bear in mind
in those long negotiations which we held all during
the months of one spring and summer over that
big table in the council chamber. We were nervous
when we entered upon this work, nervous as are
those who enter the finals in some tournament of
sport; we did not know much about the subject,
and we were confronted by the street railway magnates
and their clever lawyers. But we could learn
as we went along, and we always had to our assistance
Newton Baker over in Cleveland, and Peter
Witt, and Carl Nau, whom we had employed as the
city&#8217;s accountant when the time came at last when
we could examine the company&#8217;s books; they had all
gone through the long civil war in Cleveland, as
had Professor Edward W. Bemis, whom we afterwards
engaged in his quality of expert adviser on
valuations.</p>

<p>Perhaps at first we laid too great stress on three-cent
fares, though I do not know how we could have
done otherwise. Dr. Delos F. Wilcox, who has written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
an excellent work on the whole subject, had
advised us indeed that a disproportionate amount
of energy and effort had already been expended&mdash;not
by us, only, but by all those in other cities who
were in similar struggles&mdash;in the direction of low
fares. He pointed out, I remember, that five cents
in that day was worth little more than three cents
or three and a half cents had been a decade before,
according to the scale of prices then current; he
thought that in terms of general prices the public
had already secured three-cent fares without knowing
it. It was a question of some subtlety and some
intricacy, to be left to economists; we could not
feel that our battle had been won so easily, and we
did not undertake to console the people with the
recondite theory. We had before us, in vision, and
sometimes in their corporeal reality, the weary and
exasperated strap-hangers, and the human sardines
on the rear platform with their valid complaints;
they all wanted low fares, good service, and seats.
An old street-car man once said that to provide
seats for everybody is an impossibility, and to
prove this assertion he humorously classified humanity
into three groups: &#8220;workers, clerkers and
shirkers.&#8221; Each morning, he said, the workers go
down at seven, the clerkers at eight, and the shirkers
at nine, and that therefore it is easy to provide
them all with seats in the morning hours; but
that as all three classes wish to go home at the
same hour in the evening, it is then physically impossible
to provide them all with seats.</p>

<p>But whether or not too great stress was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
three-cent fares we learned during those months of
wearisome and futile negotiations, that the theory
was not scientific. The people were entitled to
their money&#8217;s worth in service, the company to adequate
pay for the service it rendered, and as the
basis of the whole transaction was a public necessity,
the city had the right to control the service, to
dictate what it should be. The old theory was that
the people existed for the street-car company; the
new principle was quite the reverse; the street-car
company was but a temporary instrument of social
service, and the social right was paramount to all
others.</p>

<p>The company therefore was entitled to a fare
sufficient to enable it to provide the service thus
demanded, and to do this it must charge enough to
pay its operating expenses, taxes, and interest,
enough to meet the cost of improvements and depreciation,
and to pay a reasonable return on its investment.
It was not entitled to any speculative
return. There was no longer on the company&#8217;s part
that risk its predecessors in interest, the pioneers or
promoters or whatever they were, had been compelled
to take; its investment was no longer precarious;
nothing, indeed, could be more certain than
the stability of street railway investments. Their
securities, based upon a public necessity, supported
by the diurnal comings and goings of all those thousands
and hundreds of thousands of people, had become
in a certain very real sense, a fixed burden
upon the people of the city, a burden as fixed and
inevitable as taxes. In the hands of private owners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
such securities, under a franchise ordinance properly
drawn, partake largely of the character of municipal
bonds, which indeed they resemble in fundamentals
and ends. The issue of securities was therefore to
be as jealously guarded as an issue of municipal
bonds, and overcapitalization, the prolific source of
so much evil, was to be prevented. The enterprise
had become as stable as any human institution can
be, and with the limited risk there was to be applied
the familiar principle of limited profit. The principle
was recognized in Cleveland, where the return
fixed as reasonable was 6 per cent., which is but little
more than municipal bonds pay. And when this
principle is established, municipal ownership almost
automatically follows; investors used to large speculative
profits, are ready to sell out to the municipality;
thus, by indirection, democracy comes into
her own.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to fix most of the elements
of this return; the accountants could do that, in
their intricate discussions of car-miles and curves
and straight lines of depreciation and points of
saturation in traffic, and all that, but the tremendous
difficulty was to determine just what the
investment was and what was a reasonable return
on that investment.</p>

<p>It is this pass to which all such negotiations, conducted
in sincerity, come at last; it is this on which
the whole question hinges, it is this that might as
well be done first as last, namely, to evaluate the
property of the company. It is necessary not only
to get at the investment and the return thereon, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
to ascertain what the city must pay when it comes
to take over the street railway system.</p>

<p>But we did not do it at first, and we did not do
it at last. At first it was impossible to get it into
the councilmanic head that it was at all necessary,
especially since it cost money to retain the &#8220;experts,&#8221;
as they are called, to do the work. They
were prone to that old vice of the human mind which
leads it to imagine that when it has stated the end
to be achieved it has at the same time stated the
means of achieving it,&mdash;like the advice to the bashful
man &#8220;to assume an easy and graceful attitude,
especially in the presence of ladies&#8221;&mdash;and when
council was finally convinced and had provided the
funds for the experts, we could not agree as to who
should be employed. That is, the human equation
was apparent. There was unhappily nobody but
men to make evaluations, and all the engineers who
were competent were employed by street railway
companies, and expected or hoped to continue to be
employed by street railway companies, and they had
evolved so many fantastic notions of &#8220;intangible&#8221;
value that they could account for almost any excess
in artificial capitalization, and make the
grossest exhibition of corporate greed in watering
stocks appear like veritable self denial in frugality
and economy. We selected Professor Bemis to represent
the city, because he was one of the few of
the &#8220;experts&#8221; committed to the people&#8217;s cause; he
had advised Tom Johnson throughout his long war.
But the company never could be brought to select
anybody, or to agree upon the third arbiter&mdash;even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
to accept the Judge of the United States Circuit
Court when, against the advice of the whole administrative
circle, I proposed him.</p>

<p>Again and again in our prolonged negotiations
we returned, as in a vicious circle, to this point;
again and again we reached this impasse.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">LXI</h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile, the franchises were expiring, and the
time drew on when the company would have no
rights left in the streets. And here was the opportunity
for the mind that had the power, or the
defect, of isolating propositions, of regarding them
as absolute, of ignoring the intricate relativity of
life. &#8220;Put the company off the streets,&#8221; was the
cry; &#8220;make it stop running its cars; bring it to its
knees.&#8221; However, we could not bring the company
to its knees without bringing the riders to their
feet; we could not put the company off the streets,
without at the same time and by the same process,
putting the people on the streets; when the cars
stopped running the people began walking. The
public convenience was paramount.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Cornell Schreiber, the City Solicitor,
hit upon a plan. He drew an ordinance providing
that the company could use the streets wherein its
rights had expired, only on the condition that it
carry passengers at a three-cent fare, and the ordinance
was at once passed by the council. It was
of doubtful legality, but it had its effect in a world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
of human beings. Before it was effective even, people
were tendering three cents as fare; and in the face
of the difficulty of dealing with a whole populace in
this mood, the company agreed to put in force a
temporary rate of three cents during the rush hours
of the morning and evening, and it lowered fares in
the other hours and made further concessions. And
there we let the matter rest.</p>

<p>And, since the education of the general mind
never stops, the people were learning. Their
patience was time and again exhausted by the unavoidable
length of the franchise dispute, for the
problem was to them, as to most Americans, new, the
legal questions in which the whole subject was
prolific had not been settled, there was the interruption
of business and convenience and pleasure
attending long continued negotiations, and perhaps
more than all that irritation of the public temper
which proceeds from all communal disputes. The
company&#8217;s representatives counted on all this to tire
the people out; and since the controversy assumed a
political complexion, and there was as always the
difficulty of sustaining the mass will, they had hopes
that by delay the people in weariness would surrender.
The time came when the sentiment in favor
of municipal ownership was so strong that the Independents
adopted the view I had expressed and
declared it to be their purpose to grant no renewals
of franchises at all, but to let the company
operate on sufferance until the city itself could take
over the lines.</p>

<p>During the course of the long struggle a change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
had come over the spirit of the people, and this
change had been reflected in the laws. The greatest
difficulty had been found in the city&#8217;s want
of autonomy; the cities of Ohio not only lacked the
power to own and operate public utilities, but they
even had few rights in contracting with the private
companies. The street-car companies had always
been more ably and assiduously represented in the
state legislature than had the people themselves;
the people had not had the strength to wrest these
powers from the legislature, and indeed, in their patience
and toryism, they had not made many efforts
to do so. Thus our campaign led us out into the
state, and the end, toward which we had to struggle,
was the free city; the last of our demands was home
rule. In the relations between public utility corporations
and the municipality, our cities were a whole
generation behind the cities of Great Britain, Germany,
France and Belgium. Indeed, in relation to
all social functions we were not much further advanced
than was Rome in the second century.</p>

<p>As to the medieval cities of Italy, the free cities
of Germany and the cities of Great Britain, struggling
all of them against some overlord, some king,
noble or bishop, so at last there came to our cities a
realization of the vassalage they were under. Their
destinies were in the hands of the country politicians
in the state legislature who had no sympathy with
city problems, because they had no understanding
of them. Oftenest indeed they had a contempt for
them, they all held to the Puritan ideal. But a demand
for freedom went up from Cleveland, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
Cincinnati, from Columbus, from Toledo. The legislature
began to make its reluctant concessions; it
gave cities, for instance, the right to have street
railway franchises referred to the people for approval
or rejection. And at last in the great awakening,
the state constitution was ultimately amended
and cities were given home rule. It was the irony of
life that Golden Rule Jones and Tom Johnson could
not have lived to see that day!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">LXII</h2>
</div>


<p>A few weeks after my election to a fourth term
I wrote out and gave to the reporters a statement
in which I said that I would not be again a
candidate for the office of mayor. I had been thinking
of my old ambition in letters, and of those novels
I had planned to write. Already I had been six
years in office and I had not written a novel in all
that time. And here I was, just entering upon another
term. If ever I were to write those novels
I would better be about it, before I grew too old
and too tired. The politicians, regarding all such
statements as but the professional insincerities of
their trade, could not consider my decision seriously
of course, or credit its intention. They were somewhat
like my friends in the literary world, or like
some of them at least, who were unable to understand
why I should not continue indefinitely to run for
mayor, though the politicians were not so innocent
and credulous, since they did not believe that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
could as inevitably continue to be elected. I suppose
it was the life of action that appealed to my
literary friends or to their literary imaginations;
they had the human habit of disparaging their own
calling, and, if they did not hold my performance
in that field as lightly as the politicians held it, they
wondered why I did not prefer politics. The politicians
in their harangues spoke of my writings bitterly,
as though they were a personal affront to
their intelligences, and urged the electorate to rebuke
me for spending my time upon such nonsense.
If I had not known that they had never read my
books, or any books, all this might have been chilling
to the literary aspiration, but I knew them to their
heart&#8217;s core, where there was nothing but contempt
for books, and, as I sometimes thought, yielding too
much to cynicism and despair, nothing but contempt
for any sort of beauty or goodly impulse. Of
course, they were not so bad as that; out of politics
they were as good as anyone or as anything; we
instinctively recognize the vitiating quality of the
political atmosphere in our constant use of the
phrase &#8220;if it could only be taken out of politics,&#8221;
as with the tariff, the currency, municipal government,
etc. But my friends in the political line could
join my friends in the literary line in the surprise
they felt at my decision to retire at the end of that
last term. The politicians did not think I meant
what I said, of course; it is quite impossible for a
politician to imagine a man&#8217;s meaning what he says,
since politicians so seldom mean what they say themselves;
they considered it merely as bad politics to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
have said such a thing at all. &#8220;It&#8217;ll embarrass you
when you run again,&#8221; they would warn me in their
bland <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>. It did not embarrass me, however,
because I would not and did not run again, though I
had to decline a nomination or two before they were
convinced, but their own lack of faith, those who
were still Independents, at least, proved an ultimate
embarrassment to them, for they neglected to agree
upon a candidate to succeed me, and by the next
election they had grouped themselves in factions,
each with its own candidate. Perhaps this untoward
result came to pass as much because the independent
movement by that time had become the Independent
party, as for any other reason discernible to the
mind of man; at least, it was disparaged by the use
of that term, which implied its own reproach in
Toledo, and its sponsors conducted themselves so
much after the historic precedents of faction in political
parties, by separating into the inevitable right
and left wing, that they managed to get themselves
soundly beaten.</p>

<p>Eight years is a long time to serve in any office.
My grandfather had given four years to the Civil
War, and I had found the mayor&#8217;s office as trying,
as difficult, and as alien as he had found his martial
experience. The truth is, that long before the eight
years were over the irritation of constant, persistent,
nagging criticism had got on my nerves, and, besides
the pain of misunderstanding and misrepresentation,
I grew to have a perfect detestation for those
manipulations which are the technic of politics.
And, then, one cannot be a mayor always,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
and it were better to retire than to be dismissed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought you didn&#8217;t mind criticism?&#8221; a
man said to me one day. &#8220;I always supposed that
after a while one became callous.&#8221;</p>

<p>My dear friend Bishop Williams of Detroit was
at the table, and I shall ever be grateful to him for
the smile of instant comprehension and sympathy
with which he illuminated the reply he made before
I had time to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, callous,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;or&mdash;raw.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was precisely that. There were those who were
always saying to me: &#8220;I know you don&#8217;t mind what
they say about you, but I never could stand it; I&#8217;m
too sensitive.&#8221; It was a daily experience, almost as
difficult to endure as the visits of those who came to
report the latest ill-natured comment; they did it
because they were friends and felt that I should know
it. But Bishop Williams knows life and understands
human nature more completely and more tolerantly
than any clergyman I ever knew.</p>

<p>And then politics have the dreadful effect of beating
all the freshness out of a man; if they do not
make him timid, they make him hesitant and cautious,
provident of his opinion; he goes about with
his finger on his lips, fearful of utterance, and, when
he does speak, it is in guarded syllables which conceal
his true thought; he cultivates solemnity and
the meretricious art of posing; humor is to be
avoided, since the crowd is perplexed by humor and
so resents it, and will have only the stale rudimentary
wit of those stories which men, straining to be
funny, match at the banquet board. And when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
indulges himself in public speech it is to pour forth
a tide of words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">Full of sound and fury,</div>
<div class="verse">Signifying nothing.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I used to be haunted continually by a horrid fear
that I should lose the possibility of ever winning the
power of utterance, since no such prudence is at all
compatible with the practice of any art. For art
must, first of all, be utter sincerity, the artist&#8217;s business
is to think out his thoughts about life to the
very end, and to speak them as plainly as the power
and the ability to speak them have been given to
him; he must not be afraid to offend; indeed, if he
succeed at all, he must certainly offend in the beginning.
I am quite aware that I may seem inconsistent
in this notion, since I have intimated my belief
that Jones was an artist; and so he was, in a
way, and, if I do not fly to the refuge of trite sayings
and allege him as the exception that proves the
rule, I am sure that I may say, and, if I have in the
least been able to convey any distinct conception of
his personality, the reader will agree with me when
I say, that he was <i>sui generis</i>. And besides it was
not as a politician that he won his success. Had he
ventured outside the political jurisdiction of his own
city the politicians instantly would have torn him
asunder because he had not been &#8220;regular.&#8221; And,
that, I find, when I set it down, is precisely what I
am trying to say about the artist; he must not be
regular. Every great artist in the world has been
irregular, as irregular as Corot, going forth in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
early morning in search of the elusive and ineffable
light of dawn as it spread over the earth and stole
through the greenwoods at Barbizon, or as Manet,
or Monet, or any other man who never knew appreciation
in his lifetime. And Jones and all like him
are brothers of those incomparable artists; they are
not kin in any way to the world&#8217;s politicians.</p>

<p>And then so many of the old guard were dead.
A strange and tragic fate had pursued us, overtaking,
one after another, our very best&mdash;Jones, first
of all, and then Oren Dunham, E. B. Southard, Dad
McCullough, Franklin Macomber, Lyman Wachenheimer,
Dr. Donnelly, William H. Maher. These
brave, true souls were literally burned out in the
fires of that fierce and relentless conflict, and then
there came that soft autumn night when seven of
our young men in a launch were run down by a
freighter on Maumee Bay and drowned, every one
of them.</p>

<p>I shall never forget Johnson Thurston as he sat
in my office during that last campaign, recalling
these men who had been to him as comrades in arms,
and, what affected him more sorely, the fact that in
our overabundant political success the ideals that
had beckoned them on had become blurred in the
vision of those who came after them. I detected
him in the act of drawing his handkerchief furtively
from his pocket, and hastily pressing it to his eyes,
as he stammered something in apology for his emotion....</p>

<p>Thus there came the irresistible conviction that
the work of the politician was not for me. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
was other work I wished to do. I doubt whether
the politician&#8217;s work is ever permanent, though it
is too much to say that it lacks real value; I have
never been able to think it out. The work of few
men, of course, is permanent, sometimes the work of
the artist least of any. But, however ephemeral, if
the artist&#8217;s work is done in sincerity, it is of far
greater worth than the work of the politician, if for
no other reason, than because, to recall again those
words of George Moore which can never lose their
charm or their consolation, the traffic of the politician
is with the affairs of this world, while the artist
is concerned with the dreams, the visions, and the aspirations
of a world that is beyond this. I have
quoted them before in these pages, I know; they cannot
be quoted too often, or too often read by us
Americans, if, by pondering them, we may plumb
their profound depths. For we all read human history
too superficially. Kings and emperors, princes
and dukes, prime ministers and generals may fascinate
the imagination for a while, but if life is ever to
unfold its possibilities to the later consciousness,
these become but the phantoms of vanished realms,
and there emerge more gracious figures, Phidias and
Theocritus; Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio; Raphael,
Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, and Correggio;
Donatello and Michelangelo; Sidney, Spenser, Tyndale,
Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson. These and
the other artists and humanists of their times are
veritable personalities in our world, far more than
Elizabeth, or the dukes of the Medici, or even Pericles.
For from periods such as these their names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
made illustrious, from the Revival of Learning, the
Renaissance, the Reformation, man emerged as Man,
clothed with the beauty and power of an emancipated
spirit. In the freedom of the mind, the spontaneous
outburst of ecstasy and delight, the new-born possibility
of loveliness and harmony and joyous existence,
they not only exalted life with art, but gained
the courage to undertake sterner examinations of its
mystery. And this same perennial spirit of humanism
built, not only the proud and voluptuous cities
of Tuscany and Lombardy, but the wealthy free
cities of Flanders and Germany&mdash;and it discovered
America, not the America of the senses alone, but
the larger, nobler America of the mind.</p>

<p>And, surely, this America is not always to bear
the reproach of having no music, and so little painting
and literature of her own. Surely the aspirations
of this new land, with the irresistible impulse
of the democratic spirit and humanistic culture are
to find emotional expression in the terms and forms
of enduring beauty. It was this sublime adventure
that interested me far more than the trivial and
repulsive wrangles of the politicians....</p>

<p>Our opponents had never known how wholly right
they were in their reiterated charge that I was but
a dreamer; incorrigible dreamer indeed, and nothing
more!</p>

<p>But in these years I had given my city the best
there was in me, little as that was, and when the
legislature made provision for the constitutional convention,
which met at Columbus, and, after months
of deliberation, submitted a long list of amendments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
to the fundamental law of the state, among them
that one which granted home rule to cities, I felt,
for it was an emotion deeper than thought, that if
the people could only be induced to approve that
amendment the long anticipated and happy release
was at hand. We had been engaged on an impossible
task; we had been trying to regenerate the city by
means of electing to office persons who in themselves
would reflect the communal aspiration, but this could
not be continued indefinitely; the cities could achieve
no genuine reform until they were autonomous.
With home rule democracy would have the means of
development, and the people the opportunity of self-expression;
they would have to depend on themselves;
they could no longer, with an Oriental fatalism,
neglect their own destiny and then lay the blame
for the inevitable catastrophe on the mayor, or the
political boss, or the country members of the legislature.</p>

<p>There were, if I remember well, about fifty of
these amendments, among them provisions for the
initiative and referendum, woman suffrage, and
many other progressive and radical doctrines, in
addition to our beloved home rule for cities, and,
when the campaign opened in behalf of their adoption,
Newton Baker, who a year before had been
elected mayor of Cleveland, proposed that he and
I make a tour of the state in a motor car and speak
for the home rule amendment, since all the others
had their devoted proponents.</p>

<p>Nothing more delightful than a campaign tour in
company with Newton Baker could be imagined, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
I had visions of our little caravan, out on the country
roads of Ohio, going from town to town, and of
our standing up in the car and speaking to the crowds
of farmers who had come into the town to hear
us, or having come for their Saturday marketing,
would pause while we told them of the needs of cities.
I had always believed that if the farmers could only
be brought to understand the cities they would not
be so obdurate with us, but would enlarge our opportunities
of self-expression and self-government. I
could fancy myself standing up and leaning over
the side of the car and talking to them, while they
stood there in their drab garments, their faces drawn
in mental concentration, looking at us out of eyes
around which were little wrinkles of suspicion,
wondering what designs we had upon them; at
first they would stand afar off, perhaps on the
other side of the street, as they used to do when
we went out to speak to them in the judicial
campaigns; but then presently they would draw
a little closer, until at last they crowded about
the car, staying on to the end, and then perhaps
even vouchsafing us the conservative approval of
scattered applause. Or I would dramatize Baker as
speaking, while I sat there utterly charmed with his
manner, his clear and polished expression, and envied
him his ability to speak with such surprising
fluency, such ease and grace, as if the fact of putting
words together so that they would form clear, logical
and related sentences were nothing at all, and
wondering why it was that everyone that heard was
not instantly converted to his plan, whatever it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
was.... And then, between times, Baker
would not be talking politics at all; he would not be
indulging in politician&#8217;s low gossip, slandering every
one he knew&mdash;the ineradicable and, I suppose, inevitable
habit of politicians, because in public they
are obliged to be so suave in utterance and so smiling
and ingratiating in manner. Baker was not like
them at all; he knew a vast deal of literature and
could talk about books with comprehension; if you
mentioned a passage from John Eglinton, or a scene
from Tourgenieff, or a poem of Yeats or Masefield,
he would know what you were talking about; he is not
one of those who, by the little deceit of a thin, factitious
smile of appreciation, pretend an acquaintance
they have never enjoyed. Baker has been able to
keep the habit of reading, even in politics, a singular
achievement. Only he would not read novels that
were in the somber or tragic manner; I used to tell
him that this was a sign he was growing old, since
only the buoyancy of youth can risk its spirit in such
darkened paths. For instance, he would never read
my novel about prisons, &#8220;The Turn of the Balance&#8221;;
he said he knew it was too terrible. But I did not
reproach or blame him. I no longer like to read
terrible books myself, since life is....</p>

<p>But that pretty scheme fell through, our tour
was abandoned, and we went separate ways, though
we did have the joy of speaking together on several
occasions, once here in Toledo, where we opened the
campaign in old Memorial Hall, and again in a town
down the state, and at last in two great meetings in
Cleveland, where they got out the old tent Johnson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
had used in his campaigns, and the audiences its
canvas walls sheltered, there under the flaring
torches, were inspired by his spirit as once they
had been by his presence, and with the enthusiasm
of them fresh in my heart I set out from
Cleveland that last week of the campaign for the
long drive to Columbus, where the campaign was to
close.</p>

<p>It was a hot day in early September; the clouds
were piled high in the west as we started, and the
air was suffocating in its dense humidity; plainly it
was to be a day of thunder and lightning and tropical
showers. My friend, Henry W. Ashley, who
understands democracy to the fundamentals (his
father was the friend of Lincoln and wrote the
Fifteenth Amendment), was with us, for he was ever
an interested spectator of our politics. We went
by the way of Oberlin because Ashley wished to see
the college campus and indulge some sentimental reflections
in a scene that had been so vitally associated
with the old struggle of the abolitionists. The
storm which had been so ominously threatening all
the morning broke upon us as we slowly made our
way through the country south of Oberlin, as desolate
a tract as one could find, and we were charged
as heavily with depression as were the clouds with
rain as we thought of the futility of attempting to
convince the inhabitants of such a land that they
had any responsibility for the problems that were
vexing the people in the cities of the state. I remember
a village through which we passed; it was about
noon, according to our watches, though, since in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
country the people reject Standard time and regulate
their leisurely affairs by &#8220;God&#8217;s time,&#8221; noon
was half an hour gone, and, after their dinners, they
were seeking the relaxation they did not seem to need.
The rain had ceased, and on the village green under
the clearing sky the old men had come out to pitch
horseshoes. Among them was a patriarch whose
long white beard, stained with the juice of the tobacco
he resolutely chewed, swept the belt of his
slack trousers; he was in bare feet. The human
foot after it has trod this earth for three score years
and ten is not a thing of beauty, and Ashley joked
me, as we labored in the mud of those deplorable
roads, for my temerity in hoping that we could convert
that antediluvian to our way of thinking.</p>

<p>Had the task been wholly mine I should not have
undertaken it, and, of course, in that instance I did
not attempt it; the old barefoot quoit player stood
to us a symbol of the implicit and stubborn conservatism
of the rural districts. But there were
others in the field, an army of them, indeed; Herbert
Bigelow, the radical preacher of Cincinnati, who had
been president of the constitutional convention;
Henry T. Hunt, Cincinnati&#8217;s young mayor; and,
most influential of all of them perhaps, James M.
Cox, destined that autumn to be elected governor of
Ohio. And, besides all these, there was the spirit
of the times, penetrating at last with its inspiring
ideas even the conservatism of the country people. I
was confident that the old man could be counted
upon to vote for the initiative and referendum at
any rate, since one so free and democratic in cos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>tume
and manner must be of the democratic spirit
as well, though I had my doubts of him in that moment
when he should put on his spectacles and examine
the amendments abolishing capital punishment,
and granting home rule to cities.</p>

<p>But the sun came out again as we climbed the hills
that overlook Mansfield, to command a lovely scene,
broad fertile valleys all renewed by the rain and
flooded with sunshine, and I remembered that Altgeld
had once lived there, and beheld this same landscape,
that he had taught school in that town and
from there had gone away with a regiment to fight
in the Civil War. The chauffeur got out and took
the chains off the tires, while we sat silent under the
influences of the beauty of those little Ohio hills.
And then, as we started on, the clouds returned, the
scene darkened, and it began to rain again, and, before
we knew, the car skidded and we were in the
ditch. The wife of the farmer whose garden fence
we had broken in our accident revealed all the old
rural dislike of the urbanite; she said she was glad
of our fate, since motorists were forever racing by
and killing her chickens, and with this difficulty I left
Ashley to deal, since he had been president of a railroad
and was experienced in adjusting claims, and,
after he had parleyed a while, I saw him take out his
pocketbook, and then the chauffeur got the car out
of the ditch and we were on our way again.</p>

<p>The scenes and the experiences of that journey
remain with me in a distinctness that is keen in my
senses still; because I suppose I felt that in the race
with time we were then engaged upon, if we were to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
reach Columbus that evening for the meeting which
was to close the campaign, I was in a symbolic manner
racing with my own fate; that campaign a success
and I should be free. I should have liked to linger
a while in Delaware, where I had spent a portion
of my boyhood when my father was a pastor there,
and where in the University my uncle William F.
Whitlock had been a professor of Latin and literature
for half a century, dean of the faculty, and, for
a while, president. As we passed by the chapel in
the shade of the old elms on the campus I felt that I
could still hear the solemn strains of the noble hymn
they sang at his funeral, the lusty young voices of a
thousand students, united with the quivering trebles
of some old clergymen, in &#8220;Faith of Our Fathers,
Living Still.&#8221;</p>

<p>My eyes could pierce the walls of the chapel,
closed and silent that afternoon for the autumn term
had not opened, and I could see myself sitting there
in the pew with our family, and looking at the portrait
in oil of my uncle on the wall, among the portraits
of the other presidents of the University,
faintly adumbrating on his great smoothly shaven
face the smile of quizzical humor which he wears in
my memory. I sat there,</p>

<p class="center">by these tears a little boy again,</p>

<p>and thought of those days so long before when at
evening he would come to our house and stand
spreading his hands before the fire for a while; he
generally brought under his arm a book for my
father to read. I remembered that he used to carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
papers in his high hat, and that his coat stood away
from his neck, round which he wore a low standing
collar, with a black cravat. He seemed to carry in
the pocket of his waistcoat an endless succession of
eyeglasses; he would use a pair, take them down
from his high nose, lay them on the table, forget
them, and, when he wished to read again, draw
another pair from his waistcoat pocket. And I
went on thinking of him as he looked over his glasses
on that evening when I had gone late into his study
and found him bent over his desk with the &#8220;Satires&#8221;
of Juvenal before him, studying his lesson for the
morrow, he said. I thought he knew all the Latin
there was left in this world, but, &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he said,
and added: &#8220;If you would sometimes study at this
hour of the night perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He did not finish his
sentence, since it finished itself.... &#8220;I don&#8217;t
exactly know how to render that passage, Professor,&#8221;
a student, blundering through an unmastered
lesson, said in conciliatory accents one morning.
&#8220;Ah, that has been evident for some time,&#8221; my uncle
replied.... And now there he lay in his coffin,
on the spot in that dim chapel where he had so often
stood up to address the students; he was gone with
all those others whose portraits hung on the wall,
men who had stood to me in my boyhood as the great
figures of the world. I should see him walking under
those trees no more, his tall form stooped in habitual
meditation.... They were all big, those Whitlock
forbears of mine, six feet tall every one of them,
grim Puritans, I think, when they first came to this
country three centuries ago.... And I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
a vision of my uncle as walking that afternoon in
other groves with all these dark ministerial figures
that towered over my boyhood. They were all Puritans,
too, strong and rugged men, inflexible, obdurate,
much enduring, stern pioneers whose like is
known no more. And I, who could join in
the lofty strains of that old hymn, as a memorial
to my uncle, could find unavailing regret
in my reverence.... But all changes, and
it was a time of change, one of those periods
which make up the whelming tragedy of this life.
And, as they had gone, so all the old combinations
had disappeared with them, resolved into the
elements that make up that shadowy vale we call
the past.... But we were driving on, racing
away from that past as fast as we could go, on by
the cemetery where my uncle lies in his grave, on
by the rocky ledges of the Olentangy, the little
stream where we boys used to swim, and, just as
darkness was falling, besmattered with mud, we
drove into Columbus, and along High Street, hideous
in the crazy decorations that were hung out in honor
of the State Fair, and up to the Neil House&mdash;and
across the street on the steps of the old state house
four or five thousand people already gathered for
the meeting at which I was to be the only speaker.
A bath and a bite of supper, and then across the
street to the meeting, and I was standing there before
that vast crowd, and over us the shadowy mass
of the old capitol, in which my grandfather had made
the first motion that was ever put in it as a member
of the senate half a century before; he told me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
his two sons danced all night at the ball with which
its opening was celebrated....</p>

<p>And so, on that brilliant Sunday morning in September,
as we entered the motor car in Columbus,
with the impressions of the great meeting of that
Saturday night still fresh and vivid in the mind, I
could settle myself for the long drive back to Toledo
over the white pikes that wound northward between
the fair fields of our beautiful Ohio, and say to myself,
over and over, with the delicious sensations of
a secret, that the relief had almost come at last, and
that now I could do the thing I loved to do&mdash;if only
the people would approve the constitutional amendments
at the election on Tuesday. There were the
happiest of auguries in the sky; it was without a
cloud to fleck its blue expanse, and the sun blazed
and its light sparkled in the fresh air, and as we
rode the fields swept by, the pastures still green, the
ripening corn tall in maturity, nodding its heavy
tassels and waving its broad leaves of dark green,
the mown fields yellow with their stubble, and the
wide land, somnolent and heavy with fecundity, already
rich with the gold of autumn.</p>

<p>And the people did approve, with vast majorities,
and among all the principles of democracy they
wrote in their fundamental law that day was that of
municipal home rule, so that all those cities, undreamed
of when the old constitution had been written,
and all those little towns, silent and sleepy in the
drowse of that Sunday afternoon, might own and
operate their public utilities, might draft their own
charters, have what form of government they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
pleased, in short, become free. And so the great
dream of Johnson and of Jones came true at last.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">LXIII</h2>
</div>


<p>It was of the Free City they had dreamed and
that they had not lived to behold the fulfillment of
their dream was, in its way, the final certification
of the validity of their services as pioneers. It is an
old rule of life, or an old trick of the fates that
seem so casually to govern life, that the dreams of
mortals are seldom destined to come true, though
mortals sometimes thwart the fates by finding their
dreams in themselves sufficient. In this sense Jones
and Johnson had already been rewarded. It had
been a dream of wonder and of beauty, the vision
of a city stately with towers, above which there
hung the glow which poor Jude used to see at evening
when he climbed to the roof of the Brown House
on the ridgeway near Marygreen. It was a city
in which there were the living conceptions of justice,
pity, mercy, consideration, toleration, beauty, art,
all those graces which mankind so long has held
noblest and most dear. It was a city wherein human
life was precious, and therefore gracious, a
city which the citizen loved as a graduate loves his
alma mater, a city with a communal spirit. There
the old ideas of privilege had given way to the
ideals of service, public property was held as sacred
as private property, power was lightly wielded, the
people&#8217;s voice was intelligent and omnipotent, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
they had learned the wisdom that confuses demagogues,
and amid the interplay of myriad forces, the
democratic spirit was ever at work, performing its
noble functions. You might have said that the
people were inspired, since they united so readily in
great constructive work, reducing to order and scientific
arrangement all the manifold needs and expressions
of the daily life, conquering in the old
struggle against nature, providing against all that
casualty and accident which make life to-day such
a snarl of squalid tragedies and ridiculous comedies
that it well may seem to be ruled by none other than
the most whimsical and spiteful of irresponsible
spirits. It was more than a city indeed, it was a
realm of reason, wherein the people at last in good
will were living a social life. The eternal negative,
the everlasting no, had given way to a new affirmation;
each morning should ordain new emancipations,
and each evening behold new reconciliations
among men. It was a city wherein the people were
achieving more and more of leisure, that life in all
her splendor and her beauty and her glory might not
pass by unhailed, unrecognized even, by so many
toiling thousands. It was the vision of a city set
upon a hill, with happy people singing in the streets.</p>

<p>These words I know but vaguely express the
vision that had come to those two men with the
unpoetic names of Johnson and Jones. When I
speak of a city where people sing in the streets I
am perfectly well aware of the smile that touches
the lips of sophistication, though the smile would
have been none the less cynical had I mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
merely a city in which there were happy people at
all. I am perfectly well aware that such a thing
in all literalness is perhaps impossible to the weary,
preoccupied crowds in the streets of any of our
cities; it would be too absurd, too ridiculous, and
probably against the law, if not indeed quite wicked.
In Mr. Housman&#8217;s somber lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">These are not in plight to bear,</div>
<div class="verse">If they would, another&#8217;s care.</div>
<div class="verse">They have enough as &#8217;tis: I see</div>
<div class="verse">In many an eye that measures me</div>
<div class="verse">The mortal sickness of a mind</div>
<div class="verse">Too unhappy to be kind.</div>
<div class="verse">Undone with misery, all they can</div>
<div class="verse">Is to hate their fellow man;</div>
<div class="verse">And till they drop they needs must still</div>
<div class="verse">Look at you and wish you ill.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And yet, it is not wholly impossible after all.
One evening in Brussels, hearing the strains of a
band I looked out of my hotel window, and saw a
throng of youth and maidens dancing in a mist
of rain down an asphalt pavement that glistened
under the electric lights. It was a sight of such
innocence, of such simple joy and gayety as one
could never behold in our cities, and it occasioned
no more remark, was considered no more out of
place or unbecoming than it would be for a man to
sprawl on one of our sidewalks and look for a dime
he had dropped. But I happened to use that phrase
about singing in the streets simply because it was
one Jones used to employ, just as Johnson used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
forever to be talking about his city set on a hill. If
Johnson&#8217;s phrase was in an old poetic strain Jones
meant literally what he said. He used to talk of
the crowds he had seen along the boulevards of
Paris, and the gayety, impossible to us, in which
they had celebrated the 14th of July, and he talked
of all this to such purpose that Toledo became the
first city in America to have a &#8220;sane&#8221; Fourth of
July.</p>

<p>Jones and Johnson, because they had vision, were
thinking in sequences far beyond the material conceptions
of the communities about them, and utterly
impossible to skulking city politicians, with their
miserable little treacheries and contemptible and
selfish ambitions. They were imagining a spirit
which might and perhaps some day will possess a
whole people. And when I intimated the pity it was
that they had not lived to see that silvery September
day when the people of Ohio voted for municipal
autonomy, I did not mean in the least to aver
that their dream had been realized for us, simply
because we had secured an amendment to our fundamental
law. Memoranda to this effect had been
noted on the roll of the constitution, but these after
all were but the cold, formal and unlovely terms that
expressed concepts which had been evolving slowly
in the public consciousness.</p>

<p>They realized, what all intelligent men must ere
long apprehend, that too great stress has been laid
on mere political activity. We have counted it as
of controlling force in human affairs, the energy behind
human activities, the cause, instead of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
effect, the motive, instead of a mere expression of
our complex life. They saw more deeply than politics,
they recognized other and mightier influences
at work, affecting the interests and the emotions of
men. They knew that there is after all, an unconscious,
subtle wisdom in the general neglect of
politics by the masses of citizens, who intuitively
know that other things are of more importance.
They were but seeking to clear the way for the
more fundamental expressions of human interest,
human emotions, human fervors, human liberties.
For of course it is not the city that makes the
people free, but the people that make the city free;
and the city cannot be free until the people have
been freed from all their various bondages, free
above all from themselves, from their own ignorances,
littlenesses, superstitions, jealousies, envies,
suspicions and fears. And it is not laws that
can set them free, nor political parties, nor organizations,
nor commissions, nor any sort of legalistic
machinery. They must themselves set themselves
free, and themselves indeed find out the way.</p>

<p>Nor is that freedom to be defined; its chief value
lies, as does that of any concept of truth, in the fact
that it is largely impressionistic, subject to the
alterations and corrections of that mysterious system
of incessant change which is life itself. The
value and even the permanence of many ideals and
many truths&mdash;for truths are not always permanent,
but are subject to the flux of life&mdash;lie in the fact
that they are impressionistic. Reduced to formal
lines and hardened into rigid detail they become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
something quite otherwise than that which they were
at first or were intended to be.</p>

<p>No, neither for them, nor for us, had the dream
come true. But it had come nearer. It had become
possible. Many obstacles had been removed; many
purifications had been wrought, many deliverances
achieved. To Cleveland and to Toledo, those two
cities by the lake, the years had brought their
changes. Not objectively, perhaps; outwardly they
were much the same&mdash;without form, inharmonious,
ugly, with the awful antitheses of our economic
system, and what is worse, the vast welter of
mediocrity and banality between. But there had
been ameliorations. In each of them there were
plans traced for beautiful civic centers with groups
of buildings and other public amenities, which, when
realized, would render them comparable in that respect
to those old cities of Europe where the benison
of art has descended on the people from the hands
of kings. And these things were coming up out of
the people, despite provincialism and philistinism
and politics; there was a new understanding of sovereignty,
not as a menace descending from above,
but as an aspiration coming up from below. And
this new aspiration in the people, pressing with the
irresistible urge of moral sentiment against old institutions
will renovate the cities and recreate the
lives in them.</p>

<p>For after all the world grows better. Not as
rapidly as we should like, but yet, in a way, better.
The immense sophistication of the modern mood, to
be sure, is apt to cast contemporary thought in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
the mould of multifold negation; and sensibilities,
long distressed by the contemplation of life in
aspects it would not wear were this more of a realm
of reason, find their only solace in that pessimism
which makes charming so much of modern poetry.
Doubtless this is the mood most congenial to the
agnosticism of the reflective, contemplative mind
in the present phase of its philosophy. It has its
undoubted fascinations, its uses, and, indeed, its
truth, part reaction though it be from the excessive
strain of contemporary life in cities, and the dull
orthodoxies of the Victorian age. To one, indeed,
who, in eight years&#8217; participation in municipal politics
might in that respect have been compared to
that character in one of Anatole France&#8217;s novels
who never opened a door without coming upon some
hitherto unsuspected depth of infamy in mankind,
it was difficult to avoid that strain. And yet, bad
as municipal government has been in this land, it is
everywhere better to-day. The level of moral sentiment,
like the level of intelligence, mounts slowly,
in wide spirals, but it mounts steadily all the time.
In not every city has the advance been so marked,
for not every city has had such personalities as
Johnson and Jones, and without personalities, democracies
seem unable to function. The old corruptions,
once so flagrant, are growing less and less,
and there is left only the residuum of meanness
and pettiness and spite, the crimes that require no
courage and entail no fear of the law, committed by
beings who never could attain the robust stature of
the old and brazen and robust offenders. The strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
is running out, attenuating, and ere long will be
extinct.</p>

<p>Those gentle pessimists of such congenial culture
may indeed point to other ages that excel
ours, say in speculative thought, and all the five
arts, but I think it is demonstrable that upon the
whole, and employing long epochs for the comparison,
things are growing better. Notwithstanding
all the ignorance and all the woe in the world to-night,
never before has there been such widespread
opportunity for enlightenment, never such widespread
comfort, never so much kindness, so much
pity for animals, for children, and, above all, never
have women been shown such consideration. It needs
no very powerful imagination, peering into the shadowy
background of human history, to appreciate
the tremendous implications of this fact. Indeed the
great feminist movement of our time, a movement
which in the histories of mankind centuries hence
will be given the sectional mark of the beginning
of a new age, is in itself the proof of a great advance,
in which the ballot will be the very least
important of all the liberties to be won.</p>

<p>With all the complications of this vast and confusing
interplay of the forces of this age, the city
is inextricably bound by its awful responsibility for
so much that is bad, for so much that is good, in
our time. And in the cities, now as always, the
struggle for liberty will go on. The old leaders
will pass, and the new will pass, and pass swiftly,
for they are quickly consumed in the stress and heat
of the passionate and savage struggle. To them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
must ever come the fatigue of long drawn opposition,
of the repeated and unavailing assaults on the
cold, solid and impregnable walls of institutions. In
this fatigue they may grow conservative after a
while, and they should pray to be spared the
acquiescence of the middle years, the base capitulation
of age.</p>

<p>But always the people remain, pressing onward
in a great stream up the slopes, and always somehow
toward the light. For the great dream beckons,
leads them on, the dream of social harmony always
prefigured in human thought as the city. This radiant
vision of the city is the oldest dream in the
world. All literature is saturated with it. It has
been the ideal of human achievement since the day
when the men on the plains of Shinar sought to build
a city whose towers should reach unto heaven. It
was the angelic vision of the mystic on Patmos, the
city descending out of heaven, and lying foursquare,
the city where there was to be no more sorrow nor
crying. It has been the goal of civilization down
to this hour of the night, when, however vaguely and
dimly, the ideal stirs the thousands in this feverish
town going about their strange and various businesses,
pleasures, devotions, sacrifices, sins. It has
been the everlasting dream of humanity. And humanity
will continue to struggle for it, to struggle
toward it. And some day, somewhere, to the sons of
men the dream will come true.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
